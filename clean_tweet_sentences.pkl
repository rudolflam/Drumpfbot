aVThey laughed at Bernie.If Bernie Sanders , after seeing the just released e-mails , continues to look exhausted and done , then his legacy will never be the same.Thank you !
p2410
aV#MakeAmericaGreatAgain https://t.co/Pzs9uwgzamHillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened !
p2411
aVHow much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb e-mails , using even religion , against Bernie !
p2412
aVThe new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails , which should never have been written ( stupid ) , because Putin likes meWatched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes .

p2422
aVToo bad Bernie flamed outIf the Republican Convention had blown up with e-mails , resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player .
p2423

p2426
aVI always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated .
p2427
aVThe Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted , no energy left !
p2428
aVToday proves what I have always known , that @Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one , not Debbie Wasserman Shultz ( @DWStweets . )
p2429
aVSorry folks , but Bernie Sanders is exhausted , just can't go on any longer .
p2430
aVHe is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect .
p2431
aVSAD !
p2432
aVThere is no longer a Bernie Sanders " political revolution . "
p2433
aVHe is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure , wants it all to end !

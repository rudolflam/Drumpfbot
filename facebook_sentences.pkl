aVThe State Department's quid pro quo scheme proves how CORRUPT our system is.
p5
aVAttempting to protect Crooked Hillary, NOT our American service members or national security information, is absolutely DISGRACEFUL.
p6
aVThe American people deserve so much better.
p7
aVOn November 8th, we will END this RIGGED system once and for all!
p8
aVCrooked Hillary's State Department colluded with the FBI and the DOJ in a DISGRACEFUL quid pro quo exchange where her staff promised FBI agents more overseas positions if the FBI would alter emails that were classified.
p9
aVThis is COLLUSION at its core and Crooked Hillary's super PAC, the media, is doing EVERYTHING they can to cover it up.
p10
aVIt's a RIGGED system and we MUST not let her get away with this -- our country deserves better!
p11
aVVote on Nov. 8 and let's take back the White House FOR the people and BY the people!

aVOf course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day.
p17
aVWhy do Republican leaders deny what is going on?
p18
aVSo naive!
p19
aVVoter fraud!
p20
aVCrooked Hillary Clinton even got the questions to a debate, and nobody says a word.
p21
aVCan you imagine if I got the questions?
p22
aVWe have all got to come together and win this election.
p23
aVWe can't have four more years of Obama (or worse!
p24
aV).
p25
aVAs Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton abused her power to get millions of dollars for the Clinton Foundation, and in return, granted so many favors to the establishment and elites.
p26
aVSO unbelievably corrupt.
p27
aVThe system is rigged and as President, I promise you, I will end it!
p28
aVYou will always be FIRST\u2014not donors, not special interests, not Washington insiders\u2014you!

aVNow we have to win.
p33
aVProud of you all!
p34
aVAnimals representing Hillary Clinton and Dems in North Carolina just firebombed our office in Orange County, North Carolina- because we are winning!
p35
aVFBI Source- Majority Of Staff On Clinton Case Wanted Her Prosecuted:
p36
aVWe've all wondered how Hillary avoided prosecution for her email scheme.

p63
aVThank you Franklin Graham!
p64
aVI vaguely remember Ms. Zervos as one of the many contestants on The Apprentice over the years.
p65
aVTo be clear, I never met her at a hotel or greeted her inappropriately a decade ago.
p66
aVThat is not who I am as a person, and it is not how I've conducted my life.
p67
aVIn fact, Ms. Zervos continued to contact me for help, emailing my office on April 14th of this year asking that I visit her restaurant in California.
p68
aVBeyond that, the media is now creating a theater of absurdity that threatens to tear our democratic process apart and poison the minds of the American public.
p69
aVWhen Gloria Allred is given the same weighting on national television as the President of the United States, and unfounded accusations are treated as fact, with reporters throwing due diligence and fact-finding to the side in a rush to file their stories first, it's evident that we truly are living in a broken system.
p70
aVHillary Clinton can spend all of her time and money pushing complete lies against our campaign, but I refuse to fall victim to this vicious cycle of personal attacks.
p71
aVIn the coming days I plan on addressing our nation in a more personal way to present my vision for how together we fight to bring back American jobs and defend our country against radical Islamic terrorism.
p72
aVI will take my message directly to the American people and bypass the unethical press that wants to see their candidate elected.
p73
aVTogether, we will make America great again.

aVDJT
p90
aVI have said on numerous occasions that in a Trump Administration, the United States will recognize Jerusalem as the one true capital of Israel.
p91
aVThe United Nations' attempt to disconnect the State of Israel from Jerusalem is a one-sided attempt to ignore Israel's 3,000-year bond to its capital city, and is further evidence of the enormous anti-Israel bias of the UN.
p92
aVJerusalem is the enduring capital of the Jewish People and the overwhelming majority of Congress has voted to recognize Jerusalem as just that.
p93
aVFurther, the decision by the Obama Administration to strike the word 'Israel' after the word 'Jerusalem' in the President's prepared text was a capitulation to Israel's enemies, and a posthumous embarrassment to Shimon Peres, whose memory the President was attempting to honor.
p94
aVIn a Trump Administration, Israel will have a true, loyal and lasting friend in the United States of America.
p95
aVDonald J. Trump
p96
aVDemocratic Governor of Minnesota just announced that the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) is no longer affordable.
p97
aVI've been saying this for years- disaster!
p98

p99
aVWe will NOT let them decide our future \u2013 YOU, the American people will decide OUR future!
p100
aVThis is a struggle for the survival of OUR nation, and this will be our last chance to save it.

p199
aVIt marks yet another in a string of terrorist incidents targeting Israeli civilians in 2016.
p200
aVPalestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas' recent attendance at the funeral of Shimon Peres, the late Israeli president and prime minister, should have marked a new chapter in Israeli-Palestinian relations.

aVLet's be honest.
p234
aVWe're living in the real world.
p235
aVThis is nothing more than a distraction from the important issues we are facing today.
p236
aVWe are losing our jobs, we are less safe than we were 8 years ago and Washington is broken.
p237
aVHillary Clinton, and her kind, have run our country into the ground.
p238
aVI've said some foolish things, but there is a big difference between words and actions.
p239
aVBill Clinton has actually abused women and Hillary has bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims.
p240

aV**REMARKS AS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY**  Thank you.
p452
aVIt is always so great to be back in New Hampshire, the state where we had our first victory in this incredible journey.
p453
aVI've come to know and love the people of New Hampshire.
p454
aVYou are strong, independent and you are free.
p455
aVWe are all going to work very hard together over the next 40 days, and we are going to win this state, we are going to win the White House.
p456
aVWe are going to take on the special interests, the lobbyists, and the corrupt corporate media that have rigged the system against everyday Americans.
p457
aVWe are going to create millions of new jobs for our people, trillions in new wealth for our communities, and rising wages for every working American.
p458
aVWe are going to create a new government that serves you, your family, and your country.
p459
aVWe are going to end the Clinton Corruption and restore dignity and honesty to government service.
p460
aVHillary Clinton is an insider fighting only for herself and for her donors.
p461
aVI am an outsider fighting for you.
p462
aVEverything you need to know about Hillary Clinton can be understood with this simple but very important phrase: Follow The Money.
p463
aVThe large corporations who support terrible trade deals that offshore jobs \u2013 they are donating to Hillary Clinton.
p464
aVFollow the money.
p465
aVThe Wall Street investors who have rigged the regulations against the middle class \u2013 they are donating to Hillary Clinton.
p466
aVFollow the money.
p467
aVThe wealthy donors who want to shut down American energy \u2013 they are donating to Hillary Clinton.
p468
aVFollow the money.
p469
aVThe special interests who want open borders are donating to Hillary Clinton.
p470
aVAgain, just follow the money.
p471
aVIn her campaign for President, Hillary Clinton has received $100 million dollars in contributions from Wall Street and the hedge funds.
p472
aVShe and Bill were paid $150 million for speeches since Bill left the Oval Office.
p473
aVThe same groups paying Bill and Hillary for their speeches were lobbying the federal government.
p474
aVTwenty-two groups paying Bill Clinton for speeches lobbied the State Department while Hillary was Secretary of State.
p475
aVFavors and access were granted to those who wrote checks.
p476
aVShe put the office of Secretary of State up for sale \u2013 and if she ever got the chance, she'd put the Oval Office up for sale too.
p477
aVShe deleted and bleached 33,000 emails after a Congressional subpoena.
p478
aV13 phones missing, several destroyed with a hammer.
p479
aVHer staffers taking the fifth amendment, and her ringleaders getting immunity deals.

aVWe're going to call them the FBI Immunity 5.
p481
aVForeign enemies with easy access to hack her server.
p482
aVLies to Congress, under oath, about turning over her work-related emails.
p483
aVShe and her financial backers will say anything, do anything, lie about anything to keep their grip on power \u2013 to keep their control over this country.
p484
aVThe American people have had it with years, decades, of Clinton Corruption and scandals.
p485
aVThey are tired of the lies, they are tired of the trivial politics, they are tired of being talked down to, looked down upon, and treated like second class citizens.
p486
aVThe Clintons are the sordid past.
p487
aVWe are the bright future.
p488
aVWhile our campaign outlines big changes and bold solutions to make your life better, the Clinton campaign focuses only on small and petty distractions.
p489
aVThis will be the year the American people say: Enough is enough.
p490
aVHillary Clinton has been a disaster for so many communities, but especially for African-American communities.
p491
aVI don't think African-Americans are going to come out and vote for Clinton \u2013 they are too smart, and they know they are being used.
p492
aVThey also know that she'll do nothing for them once the election is over \u2013 she never does, and that will never change.
p493
aVMany of them will never forget her calling young African-American men "super-predators."
p494
aVSame thing goes for Hispanic voters \u2013 they are tired of being used by people like Hillary Clinton, that have no intention of doing anything for them once the election is over.
p495
aVA Trump Administration will bring prosperity to all of our people.
p496
aVMy economic agenda can be summed up with three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs.
p497
aVWe are going to pass the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan, and we are going to lower the business rate from 35% to 15% -- making America into a magnet for new jobs.
p498
aVEvery wasteful and unnecessary regulation will be eliminated, along with every illegal executive order.
p499
aVWe will unleash the power of American energy \u2013 we are sitting on $50 trillion dollars in untapped energy reserves, and we are going to put that wealth into the pockets of the American people.
p500
aVCommon core will be ended, and disadvantaged children will be allowed to attend the school of their choice.
p501
aVThe catastrophe known as Obamacare will be repealed and replaced.
p502
aVAnd the disastrous trade deals, like NAFTA, that have caused so much pain in New Hampshire, will be renegotiated.
p503
aVNAFTA was signed by Bill Clinton, and supported by Hillary Clinton \u2013 and your state has lost 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs since it was approved.
p504
aVYou've lost 1 in 4 since China entered the World Trade Organization \u2013 another Bill and Hillary-backed deal.
p505
aVHillary Clinton has been on the wrong side of every major trade deal in her career and, if she gets the chance, she would approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership \u2013 which would destroy manufacturing in this state.
p506
aVHillary Clinton is merely a vessel for the special interests trying to strip this country of its wealth, its jobs, and its status as a sovereign nation.
p507
aVShe is a globalist who has made a career taking jobs from our country and giving them to other countries.
p508
aVI am not running to be President of the World.
p509
aVI am running to be President of the United States of America.
p510
aVFrom now on, it's going to be America First.
p511
aVHave you ever wondered why it is that all things that the American people want never seem to happen?
p512
aVThink about it.
p513
aVFor how many years have the American people asked for our tax code to be fixed?
p514
aVOr for our infrastructure to be repaired?
p515
aVOr for the waste to be removed from the budget?
p516
aVFor how many years have voters pleaded for secure borders, fair trade deals, and quality schools that serve parents and students?
p517
aVAll the things you've ever wanted for your country have been denied.
p518
aVThe reason for this is simple.
p519
aVIt's because the financial interests who control our politics and our media don't want these changes to happen.
p520
aVThese special interests control Hillary Clinton.
p521
aVShe is their chosen representative.
p522
aVShe's been there for 30 years, and has never done anything for you and your family.
p523
aVShe's there for only one reason, to protect her donors and collect their money.
p524
aVOur campaign is taking on big business, big media and big donors \u2013 we're taking them on for YOU.
p525
aVSo you can have the future you want.
p526
aVThat includes keeping your family safe.
p527
aVNew FBI statistics shows that homicide rose 15% last year in America's large cities, and that it's the largest single-year increase in 45 years.
p528
aVMore than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since January.
p529
aVThe failed politicians and the arrogant media don't want me to talk about the crime and the violence that is happening in our country.
p530
aVThey just want me to go along with the status quo.
p531
aVWell, I have news for the people trying to silence me, and trying to silence all of us.
p532
aVWe will never back down from fighting to save American lives.
p533
aVThat also means keeping our nation safe from Radical Islamic Terrorism.
p534
aVHillary Clinton can't even say the words.
p535
aVWe are also going to keep our country safe from drugs.
p536
aVNew Hampshire has suffered so greatly from the heroin crisis and the drugs pouring across our border.
p537
aVThe rate of heroin overdoses has nearly quadrupled \u2013 once again, our politicians have tragically failed this country and its people.
p538
aVI am going to stop the drugs from pouring across our border \u2013 that is a promise.
p539
aVThe people getting rich off the rigged system are the people throwing their money at Hillary Clinton.
p540
aVOur campaign is about breaking-up the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C. We're trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors, the large corporations, and the media executives.
p541
aVThey're all part of the same corrupt political establishment.
p542
aVAnd they nod along when Hillary Clinton slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable.
p543
aVI call you hardworking American Patriots and together we are going to save this country.
p544
aVTogether, we can accomplish anything we want.
p545
aVBut that means you need to show up and vote on November 8th.
p546
aVYou have to knock on doors.
p547
aVYou have to pick up that phone.
p548
aVYou have to campaign on the streets.
p549
aVSpread the love that we have in this room to the people of our country.
p550
aVTo beat the system, you have to lift your voice, pound the pavement, and get out the vote.
p551
aVVisit our website to find out how you can help.
p552
aVYou have 40 days until the election.
p553
aVYou have 40 days to make every dream you ever dreamed for your country come true.
p554
aVDo Not Let This Chance Slip Away.
p555
aVYou have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this nation.
p556
aVThe arrogance of Washington, D.C. will soon come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.
p557
aVOn November 8th, we are going to show the whole world that America is Back \u2013 Bigger and Better and Stronger than ever before.
p558
aVHere is just some of the great things that will happen for your country:  We are going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare; make childcare more affordable; bring back our manufacturing jobs; keep Radical Islamic terrorists out of our country; save the 2ndamendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.
p559
aVWe will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.
p560
aVAmerican cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.
p561
aVAmerican steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.
p562
aVAmerican hands will rebuild this nation \u2013 and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation.
p563
aVAmerican workers will be hired to do the job.
p564
aVWe will put new American steel into the spine of this country.
p565
aVI will fight for every neglected part of this nation \u2013 and I will fight to bring us all together as Americans.
p566
aVImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.
p567
aVIt is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.
p568
aVOnce more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.
p569
aVWe Will Make America Wealthy Again.
p570
aVWe Will Make America Strong Again.
p571
aVWe Will Make America Safe Again.
p572
aVAnd We Will Make America Great Again.
p573
aVThank you, and God Bless!
p574
aVMy condolences to those involved in today's horrible accident in NJ and my deepest gratitude to all of the amazing first responders.

aVThe problem with Crooked Hillary's appeal?
p576

p577
aVHillary Clinton is bought and paid for by Wall Street \u2013 BIG TIME!

p582
aVIt's so great to be in Wisconsin tonight.
p583
aVA recent Reuters poll had us tied in Wisconsin, and we were just in Iowa where we are up by 10 in the Reuters poll \u2013 and a new post-debate Google poll has us leading Hillary Clinton by 2 points nationwide, and that's despite the fact that they were suppressing bad news about Hillary Clinton.
p584
aVOn November 8th, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House.
p585
aVIt's going to be a victory for YOU, the American people.
p586
aVWe are going to end the Clinton Corruption and restore dignity and honesty to government service.
p587
aVHillary Clinton is an insider who fights only for her donors and for herself.
p588
aVI am an outsider fighting for you.
p589
aVOne of the first things we are going to do is restore law and order to this country.
p590
aVOur good friend, Sheriff Clarke, is here with us tonight.
p591
aVNew FBI statistics shows that homicide rose 15% last year in America's large cities, and that it's the largest single-year increase in 45 years.
p592
aVMore than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since January.
p593
aVHomicides are up nearly 50% in Washington D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore.
p594
aVAcross the entire nation, for cities of all sizes, small and large, the homicide rates rose by more than 10% last year.
p595
aVThis is a national crisis.
p596
aVYet, my opponent, Hillary Clinton, continues to attack the police.
p597
aVFirst, she calls our supporters \u2013 many of them cops, soldiers and firefighters \u2013 deplorable and irredeemable.
p598
aVThen, in our debate this week, she accusses the entire country, including all of law enforcement, of "implicit bias," \u2013 essentially suggesting that everyone, including our police, are basically racist and prejudiced.
p599
aVMaybe Hillary Clinton should confine her comments to herself.
p600
aVAfter all, she is the one who described young African-American men as "super-predators."
p601
aVHow can Hillary Clinton try to lead this country when she has such a low opinion of its citizens?
p602
aVHow can she lead a country when she thinks America is full of racists, deplorables and irredeemables?
p603
aVBy smearing tens of millions of hardworking, decent Americans she has rendered herself unfit to be President.
p604
aVShe has nothing but hostility in her heart for hardworking Americans, of all backgrounds, who just want to live in safety, security and peace.
p605
aVThe police officers she attacks are the same people \u2013 of all colors and nationalities \u2013 who race into danger every day to save the lives of complete strangers.
p606
aVThose fostering the dangerous anti-police atmosphere in this country share directly in the blame for the violence and chaos that threatens our most vulnerable citizens.
p607
aVMy agenda of reducing crime will benefit all Americans, but those who will benefit most are African-American and Hispanic-American citizens living in high crime communities.
p608
aVWe are going to save thousands of lives.
p609
aVThe special interests, the arrogant media, and the political insiders, don't want me to talk about the crime that is happening in our country and in our inner cities.
p610
aVThey don't want you to know about the hurt and pain that is happening to our fellow citizens.
p611
aVThey want me to just go along with the same failed policies that have caused so much needless suffering and so much preventable heartache.
p612
aVWell, I have news for the people trying to silence me and trying to silence all of us.
p613
aVI will never back down from fighting to save American lives.
p614
aVI will never back down from fighting to save America's inner cities.
p615
aVThe only people Hillary Clinton ever fights for are the special interests who write her checks.
p616
aVFollow The Money.
p617
aVHillary Clinton has been a disaster for so many communities, but especially for African-American communities.
p618

p622
aVThere is another shooting in Chicago every 2 hours.
p623
aV45% of African-American children under the age of six are living in poverty.
p624
aVThe inner cities have been left behind.
p625
aVCrime is through the roof, public education is a disaster, there are no jobs, it's dangerous to walk down the street with your child.
p626
aVTo the African-American community, I say: what do you have to lose?
p627
aVVote for Donald Trump, I will fix it.
p628
aVI will fight for you harder than anyone has ever fought for you before.
p629

p630
aVThe large corporations who support terrible trade deals that offshore jobs \u2013 they are donating to Hillary Clinton.

p637
aVFollow The Money.
p638
aVShe and her financial backers will say anything, do anything, lie about anything to keep their grip on power \u2013 to keep their control over this country.
p639
aVIn her campaign for President, Hillary Clinton has received $100 million dollars in contributions from Wall Street and the hedge funds.
p640
aVShe received $4.1 million in speaking fees from financial firms.
p641
aVShe and Bill received a total of $150 million in speaking fees from special interests since Bill left office.
p642
aVIt's all part of the rigged system being run at your expense.

aVThe same groups paying Bill and Hillary for their speeches were lobbying the federal government.
p644
aVTwenty-two groups paying Bill Clinton for speeches lobbied the State Department while Hillary was Secretary of State.
p645
aVAnd don't forget the Clinton contributors were appointed to advisory boards by Secretary Clinton \u2013 or all the favors and access granted to those who provided funds.
p646
aVShe even gave up 20% of America's uranium supply to Russia.
p647
aVShe put the office of Secretary of State up for sale \u2013 and if she ever got the chance, she'd put the Oval Office up for sale too.
p648
aVShe deleted and bleached 33,000 emails after a Congressional subpoena.
p649
aV13 phones missing, several destroyed with a hammer.
p650
aVHer staffers taking the fifth amendment, and her ringleaders getting immunity deals.
p651
aVForeign enemies with easy access to hack her server.
p652
aVLies to Congress, under oath, about turning over her work-related emails.
p653
aVThe American people have had it with years, decades, of the Clintons' scandals and corruption.
p654
aVThis will be the year the American people say: Enough is enough.
p655
aVHillary Clinton is a vessel for the special interests trying to strip this country of its wealth, its jobs, and its status as a sovereign nation.
p656
aVShe is a globalist who has made a career taking jobs from our country and giving them to other countries.
p657
aVI am not running to be President of the World.
p658
aVI am running to be President of the United States of America.
p659
aVFrom now on, it's going to be America First.
p660
aVThese special interests control Hillary Clinton.
p661
aVShe is their chosen representative.
p662
aVYou can disregard everything she says and just remember this phrase: Follow The Money.
p663
aVShe's there for only one reason, to protect her donors and collect their money.
p664
aVLook at her career.
p665
aVShe's been there for 30 years, and has never done anything for you and your family.
p666
aVShe's failed at everything.
p667
aVShe failed in Iraq, in Libya, in Syria, in Iran, in Egypt.
p668
aVShe failed on ISIS \u2013 in fact, she unleashed ISIS onto the world.
p669
aVShe failed upstate New York \u2013 promising 200,000 jobs, but instead the jobs left.
p670
aVAll she did was name a post office and a highway.
p671
aVShe failed the inner cities.
p672
aVShe's failed women and children.
p673
aVThe only people Hillary Clinton has ever delivered for are her donors.
p674
aVOur campaign is taking on big business, big media and big donors \u2013 we're taking them on for YOU.
p675
aVSo you can have the future you want.
p676
aVI'm not owned or controlled by anyone \u2013 my loyalty is to you, and no one else.
p677
aVI WILL FIGHT FOR YOU.
p678
aVMy economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs.
p679
aVWe will cut your taxes, reduce regulations, negotiate great trade deals, unleash American energy and we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare.
p680
aVWe are also going to end common core and offer school choice to every disadvantaged child \u2013 including every poor Hispanic and African-American child in America.
p681
aVWe will put every American kid on the ladder of American success: a great education, and a great job.
p682
aVThe people getting rich off the rigged system are the people throwing their money at Hillary Clinton.
p683
aVFollow the Money.
p684
aVOur campaign is about breaking-up the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C. We're trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors, the large corporations, and the media executives.
p685
aVThey're all part of the same rigged political establishment.
p686
aVThey go to the same restaurants, they attend the same conferences, they have the same friends and connections.
p687
aVAnd they are all in for a big day of reckoning on November 8th.
p688
aVGovernment will start working for you again.
p689
aVFixing things is what I do.
p690
aVJust look at my projects in New York, and around the world, where I revitalized neighborhoods and lifted up skylines.
p691
aVThat's what I want to do for our country \u2013 I want to go into every neighborhood and unlock their potential for all of our people.
p692
aVTogether, we can accomplish anything we want.
p693
aVBut that means you need to show up and vote on November 8th \u2013 and it means you need to start voting early.
p694
aVEarly voting is already underway.
p695
aVYou have to knock on doors.
p696
aVYou have to pick up that phone.
p697
aVYou have to campaign on the streets.
p698
aVSpread the love that we have in this room to the people of our country.
p699
aVTo beat the system, you have to lift your voice, pound the pavement, and get out the vote.
p700
aVVisit our website to find out how you can help.
p701
aVYou have six weeks until the election.
p702
aVYou have six weeks to make every dream you ever dreamed for your country come true.
p703
aVYou have one last magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this nation.
p704
aVDon't let it slip away.
p705
aVDon't let this chance go.
p706
aVStand up and be heard \u2013 for your family, for your city, for your country.
p707
aVThe arrogance of Washington, D.C. will soon come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.
p708
aVThis November 8th, we are going to show the whole world that America is Back \u2013 Bigger and Better and Stronger than Ever Before.
p709
aVHere is just some of what will happen starting in January of 2017:  I am going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; repeal and replace Obamacare; unleash American energy; end illegal immigration; keep Radical Islamic terrorists out of our country; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.
p710
aVWe will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.
p711
aVAmerican cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.
p712
aVAmerican steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.
p713
aVAmerican hands will rebuild this nation \u2013 and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation.
p714
aVAmerican workers will be hired to do the job.
p715
aVWe will put new American steel into the spine of this country.
p716
aVI will fight for every neglected part of this nation \u2013 and I will fight to bring us all together as Americans.
p717
aVImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.
p718
aVIt is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.
p719
aVOnce more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.
p720
aVWe Will Make America Wealthy Again.
p721
aVWe Will Make America Strong Again.
p722
aVWe Will Make America Safe Again.

aVMelania and I extend our deepest condolences to the family of Shimon Peres on the passing of their beloved father, grandfather and great-grandfather.
p744
aVOn the world stage, Shimon Peres was a visible and highly effective patriarch to another, much larger family - the people of Israel, whom he led as prime minister and president.
p745
aVShimon Peres' life always pointed toward peace.
p746
aVBearing witness to more than his share of war and its human toll, Shimon Peres devoted his leadership skills to cultivating peace between Israel and her Arab neighbors.
p747
aVHe was a consummate statesman, a distinguished patriot and a friend of peace-loving people everywhere.
p748
aVWith his hand outstretched in peace and friendship, Shimon Peres personified dignity and grace in a region of the world where both run far too short.
p749
aVMay he rest in peace.

aVREADOUT OF DONALD J. TRUMP'S MEETING WITH ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU  NEW YORK, NY - Donald J. Trump met privately today with Prime Minister Netanyahu for over an hour at Mr. Trump's residence in Trump Tower.
p878
aVThe two have known each other for many years and had the opportunity to discuss many topics important to both countries.
p879
aVMr. Trump and the Prime Minister discussed the special relationship between America and Israel and the unbreakable bond between the two countries.
p880
aVThe topics of military assistance, security and regional stability were addressed.
p881
aVMr. Trump agreed that the military assistance provided to Israel and missile defense cooperation with Israel are an excellent investment for America.
p882
aVMr. Trump said that under a Trump administration, there will be extraordinary strategic, technological, military and intelligence cooperation between the two countries.
p883
aVMr. Trump recognized Israel as a vital partner of the United States in the global war against radical Islamic terrorism.
p884
aVThey discussed at length the nuclear deal with Iran, the battle against ISIS and many other regional security concerns.
p885
aVMr. Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu discussed at length Israel's successful experience with a security fence that helped secure its borders.
p886
aVThey discussed Israel's burgeoning hi-tech and biotech economy and how it has made stunning advances improving and saving lives around the world.
p887
aVIn particular, Mr. Trump noted Israel's emergence as a world leader in cyber defense and security and its cooperation with the United States in this regard.
p888
aVMr. Trump recognized that Israel and its citizens have suffered far too long on the front lines of Islamic terrorism.
p889
aVHe agreed with Prime Minister Netanyahu that the Israeli people want a just and lasting peace with their neighbors, but that peace will only come when the Palestinians renounce hatred and violence and accept Israel as a Jewish State.
p890
aVFinally, Mr. Trump acknowledged that Jerusalem has been the eternal capital of the Jewish People for over 3000 years, and that the United States, under a Trump administration, will finally accept the long-standing Congressional mandate to recognize Jerusalem as the undivided capital of the State of Israel.
p891
aVThe meeting concluded with both leaders promising the highest level of mutual support and cooperation should Mr. Trump have the honor and privilege of being elected President of the United States.

aVToday - I outlined a plan for American economic revival - it is bold, ambitious, forward-looking plan to massively INCREASE JOBS, WAGES, INCOMES and opportunities for the people of our country!
p1057
aVTRANSCRIPT OF ECONOMIC SPEECH - DELIVERED TO THE ECONOMIC CLUB OF NEW YORK  Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you.
p1058
aVToday, I'm going to outline a plan for American economic revival \u2013 it is a bold, ambitious, forward-looking plan to massively increase jobs, wages, incomes and opportunities for the people of our country.
p1059
aVMy plan will embrace the truth that people flourish under a minimum government burden, and it will tap into the incredible unrealized potential of our workers and their dreams.
p1060
aVRight now, 92 million Americans are on the sidelines, outside the workforce, and not part of our economy.
p1061
aVIt's a silent nation of jobless Americans.
p1062
aVLook no further than the city of Flint, where I just visited.
p1063
aVThe jobs have stripped from this community, and its infrastructure has collapsed.
p1064
aVIn 1970, there were more than 80,000 people in Flint working for GM \u2013 today it is less than 8,000.
p1065
aVNow Ford has announced it is moving all small car production to Mexico.
p1066
aVIt used to be cars were made in Flint and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico.
p1067
aVNow, the cars are made in Mexico and you can't drink the water in Flint.
p1068
aVWe are going to turn this around.
p1069
aVMy economic plan rejects the cynicism that says our labor force will keep declining, that our jobs will keep leaving, and that our economy can never grow as it did once before.
p1070
aVWe reject the pessimism that says our standard of living can no longer rise, and that all that's left to do is divide up and redistribute our shrinking resources.
p1071
aVEverything that is broken today can be fixed, and every failure can be turned into a great success.
p1072
aVJobs can stop leaving our country, and start pouring in.
p1073
aVFailing schools can become flourishing schools.
p1074
aVCrumbling roads and bridges can become gleaming new infrastructure.
p1075
aVInner cities can experience a flood of new jobs and investment.
p1076
aVAnd rising crime can give way to safe and prosperous communities.
p1077
aVAll of these things, and so much more, are possible.
p1078
aVBut to accomplish them, we must replace the present policy of globalism \u2013 which has moved so many jobs and so much wealth out of our country \u2013 and replace it with a new policy of Americanism.
p1079
aVUnder this American System, every policy decision we make must pass a simple test: does it create more jobs and better wages for Americans?
p1080
aVIf we lower our taxes, remove destructive regulations, unleash the vast treasure of American energy, and negotiate trade deals that put America First, then there is no limit to the number of jobs we can create and the amount of prosperity we can unleash.
p1081
aVAmerica will truly be the greatest place in the world to invest, hire, grow and to create new jobs, new technologies, and entire new industries.
p1082
aVInstead of driving jobs and wealth away, America will become the world's great magnet for innovation and job creation.
p1083
aVMy opponent's plan rejects this optimism.
p1084
aVShe offers only more taxing, regulating, more spending and more wealth redistribution \u2013 a future of slow growth, declining incomes, and dwindling prosperity.
p1085
aVThe only people who get rich under Hillary Clinton's scheme are the donors and the special interests.
p1086
aVIn Hillary Clinton's America, we have surrendered our status as the world's great economy, and we have surrendered our middle class to the whims of foreign countries.
p1087
aVNot one single idea she has will create one net American job, or create one new dollar of American wealth for our workers.
p1088
aVThe only thing she can ever offer is a welfare check.
p1089
aVOur plan will produce paychecks, and they're going to be great paychecks for millions of people now unemployed.
p1090
aVIn the course of this campaign, I have travelled all across this country and I've met the most amazing people.
p1091
aVEvery day, I've seen the goodness and character of our country, and brave citizens proudly fighting through hard times and difficult circumstances.
p1092
aVIn many parts of our country, the hard times never seem to end.
p1093
aVI've visited cities and towns in upstate New York where half the jobs have left and moved to other countries.
p1094
aVPoliticians have abandoned these places all over our country and the people who live there.
p1095
aVWorse still, politicians have heaped scorn and disdain on these wonderful Americans.
p1096
aVMy opponent described tens of millions of American citizens as deplorable and irredeemable \u2013 how can Hillary Clinton seek to lead this country when she considers its citizens beyond redemption?
p1097
aVThe hardworking people she calls deplorable are the most admirable people I know: they are cops and soldiers, teachers and firefighters, young and old, moms and dads, blacks, whites and Latinos \u2013 but above everything else, they are all American.
p1098
aVThey love their families, they love their country, and they want a better future.
p1099
aVThese are the forgotten men and women of America.
p1100
aVPeople who work hard but don't have a voice.
p1101
aVI am running to be their voice, and to fight to bring prosperity to every part of this country.
p1102
aVToo many of our leaders have forgotten that it's their duty to protect the jobs, wages and well-being of American workers before any other consideration.
p1103
aVI'm not running to be President of the world.
p1104
aVI'm running to be President of the United States \u2013 and as your President, I will fight for every last American job.
p1105
aVWe are the nation that tamed the West, dug out the Panama Canal, won two World Wars, and put a man on the moon.
p1106
aVIt's time to start thinking big once again.
p1107
aVThat's why I believe it is time to establish a national goal of reaching 4% economic growth.
p1108
aVIn working with my economic team, we've put together a plan that puts us on track to achieve that goal.
p1109
aVOver the next ten years, our economic team estimates that under our plan the economy will average 3.5% growth and create a total of 25 million new jobs.
p1110
aVYou can visit our website to see the math.
p1111
aVThis growth means that our jobs plan, including our childcare reforms, will be completely paid-for in combination with proposed budget savings.
p1112
aVIt will be deficit neutral.
p1113
aVIf we reach 4% growth, it will reduce the deficit.
p1114
aVIt will be accomplished through a complete overhaul of our tax, regulatory, energy and trade policies.
p1115
aVRight now, under Obama-Clinton policies, the economy grew only 1.1 percent last quarter \u2013 that translates to millions of lost jobs.
p1116
aVThis is the weakest so-called recovery since the Great Depression.
p1117
aVOver the last 7 years, the economy grew only 2.1 percent, the slowest period in seventy years.
p1118
aVHad the economy grown under Obama at the same rate as Reagan, it would have meant 10 million more jobs.
p1119
aVPerhaps most shockingly, 1 in 6 men aged 18-34 are either in jail or out of work.
p1120
aVMeanwhile, another 2 million Hispanic-Americans have been added to the ranks of those in poverty.
p1121
aVOn top of it all, the Obama-Clinton policies have doubled the national debt.
p1122
aVIt took more than 230 years for the United States to accumulate it's first $10 trillion dollars in debt \u2013 it took President   Obama only eight years to add another $10 trillion.
p1123
aVNow, it would be one thing if that money had been used to completely rebuild our nation, our military, and our infrastructure.
p1124
aVInstead, the opposite happened.
p1125
aVWe doubled our debt and, in return, we have dilapidated infrastructure, failing schools, a badly depleted military, and another 14 million people who have left the workforce.
p1126
aVNever has so much money been spent so poorly.
p1127
aVBut we're going to turn that all around.
p1128
aVHere's how.
p1129
aVIt begins with bold new tax reform.
p1130
aVAs outlined in Detroit, our tax plan will greatly simplify the code and reduce the number of brackets from 7 to 3.
p1131
aVThe 3 new brackets will be 12, 25 and 33, but low-income Americans will pay no income tax at all \u2013 in fact, our plan will remove millions and millions of workers from the income tax rolls entirely.
p1132
aVBy lowering rates, streamlining deductions, and simplifying the process, we will add millions of new jobs.
p1133
aVIn addition, because we have strongly capped deductions for the wealthy and closed special interest loopholes, the tax relief will be concentrated on the working and middle class taxpayer.
p1134
aVThey will receive the biggest benefit \u2013 it won't even be close.
p1135
aVThis is a working and middle class tax relief proposal.
p1136
aVThe tax relief for these workers will be expanded by my childcare proposals that I have worked on with my daughter, Ivanka.
p1137
aVThese proposals are a central element of our comprehensive tax reform and economic growth plan.
p1138
aVFamilies will be able to fully deduct the average cost of childcare from their taxes, including stay-at-home parents.
p1139
aVBecause this deduction is capped, it will disproportionately benefit working and middle class families.
p1140
aVThe less you make, the larger a share of your income you can exclude from taxation.
p1141
aVParents will also be able to enroll in tax-free dependent care savings accounts for their children or elderly relatives.
p1142
aVLow-income households will benefit from both an Expanded Earned Income Tax Credit \u2013 in the form a Childcare rebate \u2013 and a matching $500 contribution for their savings accounts.
p1143
aVA married couple earning $50,000 per year with two children and $8,000 in child care expenses will save 35% from their current tax bill.
p1144
aVA married couple earning $75,000 per year with two children and $10,000 in child care expenses will receive a 30% reduction in their tax bill.
p1145
aVBy contrast, someone earning $5 million will receive virtually no change in their tax bill at all.
p1146
aVOne of our greatest job creation measures is going to be our 15% business tax rate \u2013 down from the current 35% rate, a reduction of more than 40 percent.
p1147
aVAn explosion of new business and new jobs will be created.
p1148
aVIt will be amazing to watch.
p1149
aVWe will also allow U.S.-based manufacturers to fully expense the cost of new plants and equipment.
p1150
aVOn top of that, we will bring back trillions in business wealth parked overseas and tax it at a 10% rate.
p1151
aVSome people say there are $2 trillion dollars overseas, I think it's $5 trillion.
p1152
aVBy taxing it at 10% instead of 35%, all of this money will come back into our country.
p1153
aVWe will turn America into a magnet for new jobs \u2013 and that means jobs in our poorest communities.
p1154
aVNext, comes regulations.
p1155
aVOne of the keys to unlocking growth is scaling-back years of disastrous regulations unilaterally imposed by our out-of-control bureaucracy.
p1156
aVRegulations have grown into a massive, job-killing industry \u2013 and the regulation industry is one business I will put an end to.
p1157
aVIn 2015 alone, federal agencies issued over 3,300 final rules and regulations, up from 2,400 the prior year.
p1158
aVEvery year, overregulation costs our economy $2 trillion dollars a year and reduces household wealth by almost $15,000 dollars.
p1159
aVI've proposed a moratorium on new federal regulations that are not compelled by Congress or public safety, and I will eliminate all needless and job-killing regulations now on the books.
p1160
aVThis includes eliminating some of our most intrusive regulations, like the Waters of The U.S. Rule.
p1161
aVIt also means scrapping the EPA's so-called Clean Power Plan which the government itself estimates will cost $7.2 billion a year.
p1162
aVThis Obama-Clinton directive will shut down most, if not all, coal-powered electricity plans in America.
p1163
aVRemember what Hillary Clinton said?
p1164
aVShe wants to shut down the miners, just like she wants to shut down the steel mills.
p1165
aVWe're going to put our great miners and steel workers back to work.
p1166
aVEnergy reform is central to our plan as well According to the Heritage Foundation, by 2030, President Obama's energy restrictions will eliminate another half a million manufacturing jobs, reduce economic output by $2.5 trillion dollars, and reduce incomes by $7,000 dollars per person.
p1167
aVHillary Clinton wants to go even further, and her plan could cost the economy $5 trillion dollars.
p1168
aVA Trump Administration will lift restrictions on all sources of American energy production.
p1169
aVAccording to the Institute for American Energy Resources this will: increase GDP by more than $100 billion annually add over 500,000 new jobs annually increase annual wages by more than $30 billion over the next 7 years increase federal, state, and local tax revenues by almost $6 trillion over 4 decades increase total economic activity by more than $20 trillion over the next 40 years.
p1170
aVIn addition, we will streamline the permitting process for all energy infrastructure projects, including the billions of dollars in projects held up by President Obama \u2013 creating countless more jobs in the process.
p1171
aVFinally, comes trade \u2013 the foundation for everything America's annual trade deficit with the world is now nearly $800 a billion a year \u2013 an enormous drag on growth.
p1172
aVBetween World War II and the year 2000, the United States averaged a 3.5% growth rate.
p1173
aVBut, after China joined the World Trade Organization, our average growth rate has been reduced to only 2 percent.
p1174
aVPredatory trade practices, product dumping, currency manipulation and intellectual property theft have taken millions of jobs and trillions in wealth from our country.
p1175
aVIt is no great secret that many of the special interests funding my opponent's campaign are the same people profiting from these terrible trade deals.
p1176
aVThe same so-called experts advising Hillary Clinton are the same people who gave us NAFTA, China's entry into the World Trade Organization, the job-killing trade deal with South Korea, and now the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
p1177
aVThe verdict is in.
p1178
aVAll of the special interests that the media race to for comment have been proven wrong about every single deal they've promoted \u2013 every lie and every prediction has crashed upon the rocks of reality.
p1179
aVOur manufacturing base has crumbled, communities have been hollowed out, wages have declined, and households are making less today than they were in the year 2000.
p1180
aVI have proposed a detailed plan to reform our trade policies and bring vast new jobs and wealth to America.
p1181
aVThis includes the following steps: I'm going to direct the Secretary of Commerce to identify every violation of trade agreements a foreign country is currently using to harm our workers.
p1182
aVI will use every tool under American and international law to end these abuses, and I will use our greatest business leaders and finest negotiators \u2013 and I know who you are, many of you are in the room.
p1183
aVWe are going to start with NAFTA, which is causing so much damage to our country.
p1184
aVWe will entirely renegotiate NAFTA into a deal that will either be good for us or will be terminated until a brand new and productive deal can be signed.
p1185
aVWe are also going to keep America out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
p1186
aVNext, I am going to instruct my Treasury Secretary to label China a currency manipulator, and to apply tariffs to any country that devalues its currency to gain an unfair advantage over the United States.
p1187
aVI am going to instruct the U.S. Trade Representative to bring trade cases against China.
p1188
aVChina's unfair subsidy behavior is prohibited by the terms of its entrance to the WTO, and I intend to enforce those rules.
p1189
aVIf China does not stop its illegal activities, including its theft of American trade secrets and intellectual property, I will apply countervailing duties until China ceases and desists.
p1190
aVJust the single action of enforcing intellectual property rules alone would add millions of new American jobs.
p1191
aVAccording to the U.S. International Trade Commission, improved protection of America's intellectual property in China would add 2 million jobs a year to the United States every single year.
p1192
aVWe are going to stop the outflow of jobs from our country, and open a new highway of jobs back into our country.
p1193
aVHere is how the plan adds up.
p1194
aVWe are proposing a $4.4 trillion tax cut that will score as $2.6 trillion under a dynamic growth model, which is how taxes should be scored.
p1195
aVThis includes the childcare plan.
p1196
aVOur economic team has further modeled that the growth-induced savings from trade, energy and regulation reform will shave at least another $1.8 trillion off of the remaining cost.
p1197
aVThat leaves around $800 billion dollars.
p1198
aVThis money can all be saved through simple, common sense reforms.
p1199
aVIf we save just one penny of each federal dollar spent on non-defense, and non-entitlement programs, we can save almost $1 trillion over the next decade \u2013 again this is spending that does not touch defense, and that does not touch entitlements.
p1200
aVIf our plan exceeds the 3.5% ten-year growth average, then our jobs proposal will actually reduce the deficit.
p1201
aVSavings will be compounded by the fact that people who are currently receiving unemployment or welfare will finally be able to find jobs.
p1202
aVThis is the most pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-family plan put forth perhaps in the history of our country.
p1203
aVThis is what our new future will look like.
p1204
aVI am going to lower you taxes; I am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations, on business and in your life; I'm going to unleash American energy; I'm going to repeal and replace Obamacare; I'm going to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution; I'm going rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; I'm going to save your 2nd amendment; I'm going to stop illegal immigration and drugs coming into our country, and yes, we will build the wall [Mexico will pay]; and I'm going to renegotiate our disastrous trade deals, especially NAFTA \u2013 and we will only make great trade deals that put the American worker first.
p1205
aVAnd we are going to put our miners and our steelworkers back to work.
p1206
aVWe will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.
p1207
aVAmerican cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.
p1208
aVAmerican steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.
p1209
aVAmerican hands will rebuild this nation \u2013 and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation.
p1210
aVAmerican workers will be hired to do the job.
p1211
aVWe will put new American metal into the spine of this country.
p1212
aVJobs will return, incomes will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores.
p1213
aVWe Will Make America Wealthy Again.
p1214
aVWe Will Make America Strong Again.
p1215
aVAnd Will Make America Great Again.
p1216
aVThank you, and God Bless!
p1217
aVWashington's rigged system feeds on excessive regulations...the Trump plan will put an end to this on DAY ONE.

aVFULL TRANSCRIPT   My Child Care Reforms That Will Make America Great Again!
p1261
aVThank you.
p1262
aVI want to applaud my daughter, Ivanka, for her work and leadership on the issues facing working moms in our country.
p1263
aVShe has been deeply invested in this since long before the campaign began, and I am so grateful for her work and efforts on this proposal which I will be outlining today.
p1264
aVI want to also take a moment to recognize Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Chairwoman of the House Republican Conference and a mother of three small children, who has been such a leader on these issues.
p1265
aVWe are also joined tonight by some amazing members of Congress in our audience: Congresswoman Blackburn, Lummis, Black, and Ellmers.
p1266
aVOur campaign is about ideas.
p1267
aVWe're about solutions.
p1268
aVI've travelled all over the country in recent weeks offering detailed plans to make life better for you and your family.
p1269
aVI've outlined detailed proposals for providing school choice, reforming our tax and regulatory code, lifting restrictions on American energy, rebuilding our military, changing our foreign policy, fixing our immigration policy, and keeping our country safe.
p1270
aVRight now, our politicians have locked our country into endless fights about small and petty things.
p1271
aVI'm asking the nation to lift our sights, and to imagine what we can accomplish if we work together, trust each other, and put the needs of our own citizens first.
p1272
aVWe must break our ties with the failed and bitter politics of the past and pursue a future where every American is honored and respected.
p1273
aVWe have to reject the arrogance of Washington D.C. that looks down on everyday hardworking people.
p1274
aVToo often those who have power have disdain for the views, beliefs and attitudes of those who don't have political power.
p1275
aVThose in leadership must put themselves in the shoes of the laid-off factory worker, the family worried about security, or the mom struggling to afford childcare.
p1276
aVThat means we need working mothers to be fairly compensated for their work, and to have access to affordable, quality child care for their kids.
p1277
aVWe want higher pay, better wages, and a growing economy for everyone.
p1278
aVThese solutions must update laws passed more than half a century ago when most women were still not in the labor force.
p1279
aVToday, nearly 2 in 3 mothers with young children have jobs.
p1280
aVFor many families in our country, childcare is now the single largest expense \u2013 even more than housing.
p1281
aVYet, very little meaningful policy work has been done in this area \u2013 and my opponent has no childcare plan.
p1282
aVMany Americans are just one crisis away from disaster \u2013 a sick kid, a lost job, a damaged home.
p1283
aVThere is no financial security.
p1284
aVBut that will all change under our pro-family, pro-child, pro-worker plans I am outlining tonight.
p1285
aVBefore going any further, I want everyone watching on TV right now to go to DonaldJTrump.com to read the full plan.
p1286
aVThe first part of my childcare plan allows every parent or family in America \u2013 including adoptive parents and foster parent guardians \u2013 to deduct their childcare expenses from their income taxes.
p1287
aVThey will be able to fully deduct the average cost of child care for their state, from birth through the age of 13.
p1288
aVBecause of the way the benefit is capped and structured, our plan will bring relief to working and middle class families.
p1289
aVThe deduction also applies to elder care, capped at a $5,000-dollar deduction per year.
p1290
aVImportantly, our policy also supports mothers who choose to stay at home, and honors and recognizes their incredible contributions to their families and to our society.
p1291
aVFamilies with a stay-at-home parent will be able to fully deduct the average cost of child care from their taxes.
p1292
aVFor low-income individuals who have no net income tax liability, we will offer an expanded Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) in the form of a childcare rebate.
p1293
aVWorking parents can get an expanded EITC benefit that equals up to half of their total payroll tax \u2013 a major relief for low-income parents.
p1294
aVThis translates to as much as an extra $1,200 dollars in EITC benefits for working families.
p1295
aVNext, our plan allows every parent in America to open up a Dependent Care Savings Account.
p1296
aVFamilies can contribute up to $2,000 dollars a year to these accounts completely tax-free.
p1297
aVCrucially, unlike the flexible spending accounts that exist today, these accounts will be available to all Americans \u2013 you won't have to depend on your employer to provide them.
p1298
aVImmediate family and employers can also contribute to a dependent account, each of which is designated for a specific child, including an unborn child.
p1299
aVThe money that is put into these accounts can also be spent not only on child care, but also child enrichment activities.
p1300
aVAdditionally, the funds in these accounts do not expire at the end of the year \u2013 they don't revert to employers or to the Treasury.
p1301
aVInstead, the funds rollover \u2013 so while only $2,000 dollars can be contributed each year, unspent sums can accumulate and create substantial savings.
p1302
aVThese savings can then be used by parents to help give their kids school choice, and will thus contribute to the school choice reforms I outlined last week.
p1303
aVThe funds will remain in the account until the age of 18.
p1304
aVWhatever still remains at that time can be used to help offset the costs of higher education.
p1305
aVFor low-income individuals, the federal government will provide matching funds \u2013 if parents contribute $1,000 dollars, the federal government will provide a $500 dollars match.
p1306
aVTo help low-income families reach these targets and save money, we will put a box on federal income tax forms allowing these parents to have their Earned Income Tax Credit funds directly deposited into their Dependent Care Savings Accounts.
p1307
aVThese Dependent Care Savings Accounts can also be set-up to provide care for elderly dependents.
p1308
aVOur plan also includes much needed regulatory reform to incentivize private sector solutions.
p1309
aVThe new funds offered by our plan will create a new market for innovative childcare solutions.
p1310
aVBut to make sure these solutions are available, especially in low-income and rural communities, we must reduce regulations that favor large institutional care facilities.
p1311
aVWe will allow the states to make the decisions that are right for them.
p1312
aVIn this era of the sharing economy, we want parents to be able to access lower-cost, competitive and innovative solutions at the click of a button \u2013 including services like nanny-sharing.
p1313
aVOur plan would also cover care provided by relatives and grandparents.
p1314
aVOur plan includes incentives for more employers to offer on-site childcare as well.
p1315
aVThis can often be a good solution for many working parents, and can save them up to 30 minutes of commute time.
p1316
aVCurrently, only 7% of employers provide these services.
p1317
aVOur plan will expand tax deductions for employers, allow companies to pool resources to provide shared childcare services, and remove needless requirements that have prevented employers from using the credit.
p1318
aVFinally, our plan offers a crucial safety net for working mothers whose employers do not provide paid maternity leave.
p1319
aVThis solution will receive strong bipartisan support, and will be completely self-financing.
p1320
aVBy recapturing fraud and improper payments in the unemployment insurance program, we can provide 6 weeks of paid-maternity leave to any mother with a newborn child whose employer does not provide the benefit.
p1321
aVThis maternity leave will be paid straight out of the unemployment insurance fund and, again, this safety net will be completely paid-for through savings within the program.
p1322
aVThere are more reforms and solutions in our childcare plan, and you can review them all on the website.
p1323
aVOn Thursday, I will outline my full economic plan, which is completely paid for through economic growth and proposed federal budget savings.
p1324
aVTogether, our tax, trade, regulatory, and energy policies will add trillions in new deficit-lowering growth.
p1325
aVThese are the kinds of solutions I want to bring to the White House as your President.
p1326
aVIt's time to free ourselves from the baskets that politicians try to put us in, and instead to work together \u2013 not as Republicans or Democrats \u2013 but as Americans, to achieve real, positive results for the American people.
p1327
aVWhile my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable, I call you, hard-working American Patriots who love your country, love your families, and want a better future for all Americans.
p1328
aVIt's time to end the rule of special interests, and to begin the rule of the American people.
p1329
aVIt's time to stop fighting over the smallest words, and to start dreaming about the great adventures that lie ahead.
p1330
aVIt is time to Believe In America.
p1331
aVTogether, We Will Make Our Country Strong Again.

aVMy first victory took place here.
p1651
aVOver the next 74 days, we are all going to work very hard together to win this state \u2013 just like we did in the primaries \u2013 and to win the White House for the American people.
p1652
aVOur victory is going to be a victory for the great majority of Americans whose voice has not been heard.
p1653
aVYear after year, we live under a Washington regime that ignores your demands, rejects your cries for help, and that always puts your needs last.
p1654
aVThe real divide in this election is not between left and right, but between everyday working people and a corrupt political establishment that works only for itself.
p1655
aVThis election is a chance for the great majority of decent citizens to end the rule of a small group of special interests and to return that power to the voters.
p1656
aVHillary Clinton believes only in government of, by and for the powerful.
p1657
aVI am promising government of, by and for the people.
p1658
aVIn this fight, we are taking on some very entrenched and well-financed interests.
p1659
aVThese are the same people who pay Hillary $10,000 dollars a minute for a speech.
p1660
aVThese special interests are the same people who own the newspapers that cover-up her crimes.
p1661
aVThese are the Wall Street firms who paid Hillary Clinton a quarter of a million dollars each time she delivered her secret remarks.
p1662
aVThey are the same people who paid Bill and Hillary Clinton over $150 million dollars for speeches since Bill left the Oval Office \u2013 and who donated countless millions more to the Clinton Foundation.
p1663
aVBut, you have the power, with your vote, to defeat those special interests and put the people back in charge once more.
p1664
aVThis has been a historic week in American politics.
p1665
aVThe voters have always known that our leadership in Washington D.C. is corrupt, and that the system is very badly rigged.
p1666
aVBut this week the curtain was lifted.
p1667
aVThe corruption was revealed for all to see.
p1668
aVThe veil was pulled back on a vast criminal enterprise run out of the State Department by Hillary Clinton.
p1669
aVAs the Associated Press documented, more than half of the meetings Hillary Clinton took as Secretary of State with people outside government were Foundation donors.
p1670
aVHillary Clinton's chief of staff received more messages from the Clinton Foundation's Chief Operating Officer than just about anyone else.
p1671
aV85 donors alone that she met with as Secretary gave the Foundation $156 million dollars.
p1672
aVOn top of that, Bill Clinton's total speaking fees rose 44% while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State \u2013 often raking in money from people who had business or matters before the State Department.
p1673
aVAs I said weeks ago, Hillary Clinton ran the State Department like a personal hedge fund.
p1674
aVIt is hard to tell where the Clinton Foundation ended, and where the State Department began.
p1675
aVAccess and favors were sold for cash.
p1676
aVIt's called Pay-For-Play.
p1677
aVOver and over and over, people who donated to the Clinton Foundation \u2013 or who gave money to Bill Clinton \u2013 got favorable treatment from Hillary Clinton's State Department.
p1678
aVThe examples are too many to name here in full, and I've gone over some in recent days.
p1679
aVThey include the deal to sell 20% of U.S.
p1680
aVUranium to Russia, or the favorable treatment for UBS.
p1681
aVIt includes the exemption of Telecom Giant Ericsson from government sanctions.
p1682
aVIt includes efforts to put a Foundation donor \u2013 with no national security experience \u2013 onto a highly-sensitive national security panel with access to top secret information.
p1683
aVIt includes Foundation donors getting lucrative contracts in Haiti \u2013 all while the people of Haiti suffered horribly.
p1684
aVBut these examples are only the tip of the Clinton Corruption iceberg.
p1685
aVHillary Clinton's actions constitute all of the elements of a major criminal enterprise.
p1686
aVShe created a private illegal email server in order to hide her corrupt dealings.
p1687
aVShe did so knowing full well it would put American lives at risk by making classified information highly vulnerable to foreign hacking.
p1688
aVBut, she didn't care \u2013 as long as it helped her get away with her crime, no risk to America was too great.
p1689
aVThen, to further cover-up her crime, she deleted 33,000 emails to keep them out of the hands of authorities and the American public.
p1690
aVAs a further element of the criminal cover-up, she claimed under penalty of perjury that she turned over all of her work related emails.
p1691
aVWe now know this to be one more massive Clinton lie.
p1692
aVThe FBI found thousands of work-related emails she failed to turn over, including the new discovery this week of 15,000 more work-related emails she failed to disclose.
p1693
aVWhat is being uncovered now is one of the most shocking scandals in American political history.
p1694
aVA Secretary of State sold her office to corporations and foreign governments, betraying the public trust \u2013 putting innocent lives in danger \u2013 and then she went to great lengths to hide, delete, destroy and lie about the evidence.
p1695
aVJust like her lie that she never sent any material marked classified.
p1696
aVLie after lie after lie.
p1697
aVThis is the corruption we expect to see in a Third World country \u2013 but not in America.
p1698
aVJust imagine the damage to our security, to our integrity, to our standing in the world, if Hillary Clinton is allowed to sell the Oval Office the same way she sold her office as Secretary of State.
p1699
aVWe cannot let this happen.
p1700
aVWe must vote on November 8th to keep the American government from being sold to the highest bidder.
p1701
aVVote to save your country.
p1702
aVVote to protect your family.
p1703
aVVote for honesty, integrity and accountability.
p1704
aVNow, as all of these revelations have been discovered this week, Hillary Clinton has been in hiding.
p1705
aVBut today, she emerges.
p1706
aVHowever, she is emerging not to take responsibility for her unethical and criminal conduct, but instead to make one of the most brazen attempts at distraction in the history of politics.
p1707
aVNow, I have not seen Hillary Clinton's remarks.
p1708
aVAnd, in a sense, I don't want to dignify them by dwelling on them too much, but a response is required for the sake of all decent voters she is trying to smear.
p1709
aVThe news reports are that Hillary Clinton is going to try to accuse this campaign, and the millions of decent Americans who support this campaign, of being racists.
p1710
aVIt's the oldest play in the Democratic playbook.
p1711
aVWhen Democratic policies fail, they are left with only this one tired argument.
p1712
aVIt's the last refuge of the discredited politician.
p1713
aVThey keep going back to this same well, but the well has run dry.
p1714
aVThis is the year that the people who have been betrayed by Democratic policies, including millions of African-American and Hispanic-American citizens, reject the politicians who have failed them and vote for change.
p1715
aVAs I've discussed for many days now, Democratic politicians have run nearly every inner city in America for fifty or sixty years or more.
p1716
aVTheir policies have produced only more poverty, joblessness, and failing schools.
p1717
aVEvery policy Hillary Clinton supports is a policy that has failed and betrayed communities of color in this country.
p1718
aVBut she just doesn't care \u2013 she's too busy raking in cash from the people rigging the system.
p1719
aVNearly 4 in 10 African-American children live in poverty.
p1720
aV58% of African-American youth are not working.
p1721
aVMore than 2,700 people have been shot in Chicago this year alone.
p1722
aVThese are the consequences of Hillary Clinton's policies.
p1723
aVShe has brought nothing but pain and heartache to our inner cities.
p1724
aVOn top of that, she wants to raise taxes on African-American owned businesses to as much as nearly 50 percent.
p1725
aVWe should be helping these businesses to grow and expand \u2013 but Hillary Clinton is trying to shut them down.
p1726
aVShe opposes school choice.
p1727
aVShe supports open borders that violate the civil rights of African-Americans by giving their jobs to people here unlawfully.
p1728
aVShe supports trade policies that have closed factories in African-American communities and put millions of African-Americans out of work.
p1729
aVShe supports radical regulations that put Americans out of work and raise the price of their energy bills.
p1730
aVShe supports policies on crime that make communities less safe, and that make it harder to raise your children in security and peace.
p1731
aVI believe every single parent in this country \u2013 and especially in the inner cities \u2013 has the right to raise their kids in safety.
p1732
aVThis is one of the great civil rights issues of our time.
p1733
aVBut Hillary Clinton doesn't want to talk about any of this.
p1734
aVShe can't defend her record.
p1735
aVShe doesn't have one single proposal that hasn't been tried and failed.
p1736
aVShe doesn't have one idea that does anything but destroy jobs for African-American and Hispanic citizens \u2013 and all citizens \u2013 in our country.
p1737
aVSo what does she do when she can't defend her record?
p1738
aVShe lies, she smears, she paints decent Americans as racists.
p1739
aVShe bullies voters, who only want a better future, and tries to intimidate them out of voting for change.
p1740
aVAs I discussed yesterday, these are the same tactics the establishment powers used to try to scare the British people out of voting for change too.
p1741
aVIt didn't work there.
p1742
aVIt won't work here.
p1743
aVThe American people are ready to vote for freedom, opportunity and justice.
p1744
aVThey are ready to take back control of their own futures.
p1745
aVIt's time the Clintons were held accountable for their inappropriate conduct.
p1746
aVAccording to the book Game Change, Bill Clinton said about President Barack Obama that "a few years ago this guy would have been getting us coffee."
p1747
aVAnd we've all seen the cringe-worthy comments from Hillary Clinton, which I won't get into here but we all know what they are.
p1748
aVHere's the important point though that I want to get across today.
p1749
aVHillary Clinton isn't just attacking me, she's attacking all the people who support our movement.
p1750
aVWe can't let that stand.
p1751
aVVoters are used to the old game where failed politicians like Hillary Clinton falsely smear Republicans with charges of racism.
p1752
aVRepublicans then back down.
p1753
aVDemocrats then continue to push policies that are devastating to communities of color.
p1754
aVWe must break this corrupt cycle.
p1755
aVAnd we are going to break it beginning today.
p1756
aVSo let me make some very clear statements before this whole country.
p1757
aVFirst, on the border.
p1758
aVPeople who want their laws enforced and respected, and who want their border secured, are not racists.
p1759
aVThey are patriotic Americans of all backgrounds who want their jobs protected and their country kept safe.
p1760
aVI will never apologize for pledging to enforce and uphold every single law of the United States, and to make my immigration priority defending and protecting American citizens above every other single consideration.
p1761
aVWe will end illegal immigration and we will restore the Constitutional rule of law.
p1762
aVNext, on national security.
p1763
aVPeople who speak out against Radical Islam, and who warn about refugees, are not Islamophobes.
p1764
aVThey are decent American citizens who want to uphold our values as a tolerant society, and who want to keep the terrorists out of our country.
p1765
aVIf the choice is between saving lives \u2013 or appeasing politically-correct censors in Washington D.C., that is the easiest choice I will ever have to make.
p1766
aVI will always choose saving American lives.
p1767
aVNow, on crime.
p1768
aVPeople who support the police, and who want crime reduced, are not prejudiced.
p1769
aVThey are concerned and loving citizens whose hearts break every time an innocent child is lost to preventable violence.
p1770
aVThere is no compassion in tolerating crime, and poisonous drug dealing, and the killings in our streets.
p1771
aVI will work to dismantle the criminal gangs and cartels and to liberate our poorest citizens from crime and violence and poverty and fear.
p1772
aVTo Hillary Clinton, and to her donors and advisors, pushing her to spread her smears and her lies about decent people, I have three words.
p1773
aVI want you to hear these words, and remember these words: Shame On You.
p1774
aVWhen you are like the Clintons, getting $69 million dollars in political contributions from Wall Street and Big Banks, it is easy to look down on the so-called little people.
p1775
aVIt's easy to ignore the devastation caused by our open borders when you spend all your time with wealthy donors and Hollywood celebrities.
p1776
aVIt is easy to ignore the heartfelt concerns of communities about Radical Islam entering our country, when you spend your time hanging out with foreign dictators in their lavish palaces.
p1777
aVAnd it is easy, no doubt, for Hillary Clinton to turn a blind eye to the ravages of crime, when she has her own personal armed security force.
p1778
aVThis is how the system is rigged.
p1779
aVFor decades, the American people have demanded that their immigration laws be enforced and that their jobs be protected from out-of-control immigration.
p1780
aVBut the special interests, who only want cheap labor, have stopped it from happening.
p1781
aVFor years, the American people have worried about letting Radical Islam spread within our shores, but the elites \u2013 who only want to raise more money from global corporations \u2013 ignore the concerns of the American voters.
p1782
aVFor fifty years, people living in our inner cities have suffered under a failed policy regime.
p1783
aVBut the Democratic politicians \u2013 who only want to please media executives and Wall Street donors \u2013 do nothing but expand the hurt and the suffering.
p1784
aVIt is time for a new day to dawn in America.
p1785
aVOn November 8th, we will end the rule of special interests \u2013 and we will begin the rule of the people.
p1786
aVI am asking for your vote so that we can break free from the failures of the past and create a New American Future.
p1787
aVI am asking for your vote so that we can achieve amazing things for the American people.
p1788
aVI am asking for the vote of every African-American, and Hispanic-American, who wants a better future \u2013 a future that begins with jobs, jobs and more jobs.
p1789
aVWe will fix our disastrous trade deals and stand up to countries that cheat.
p1790
aVWe will lower taxes and create millions of new jobs as a result.
p1791
aVWe will unleash an American energy revolution.
p1792
aVWe will eliminate job-killing regulations.
p1793
aVWe will repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare.
p1794
aVWe will enforce our immigration laws, and we will put rules in place that hire American workers first.
p1795
aVWe will end the era of nation-building, and instead work in partnership with our allies to crush and destroy ISIS.
p1796
aVWe will keep Radical Islamic Terrorism out of our country.
p1797
aVWe will promote the values of tolerance, justice and acceptance.
p1798
aVWe will steadfastly reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms.
p1799
aVAmerica will be one nation \u2013 united in common purpose and common dreams.
p1800
aVOur citizens will proudly promote our values and our system of government as the best in the world \u2013 and we will do so without apology.
p1801
aVTogether, We Will Make America Prosperous Again.
p1802
aVWe Will Make America Proud Again.
p1803
aVWe Will Make America Safe Again.
p1804
aVFriends, citizens and fellow Americans: We Will Make America Great Again.
p1805
aVThank you, and God Bless!
p1806
aVDonald J. Trump
p1807
aVHillary Clinton's actions constitute all of the elements of a major criminal enterprise - she created a private illegal email server in order to hide her corrupt dealings.
p1808
aVShe did so knowing full well it would put American lives at risk by making classified information highly vulnerable to foreign hacking.
p1809
aVBut, she didn't care \u2013 as long as it helped her get away with her crime, no risk to America was too great.
p1810
aVThen, to further cover-up her crime, she deleted 33,000 emails to keep them out of the hands of authorities and the American public.
p1811
aVAs a further element of the criminal cover-up, she claimed under penalty of perjury that she turned over all of her work related emails.
p1812

p1813
aVThe FBI found thousands of work-related emails she failed to turn over, including the new discovery this week of 15,000 more work-related emails she failed to disclose.
p1814
aVWhat is being uncovered now is one of the most shocking scandals in American political history.
p1815
aVUnder a Trump presidency, America will be one nation \u2013 united in common purpose and common dreams.
p1816
aV-Donald J. Trump
p1817
aVHillary Clinton is using race-baiting to try to get African-American voters- but they know she is all talk and NO ACTION!
p1818
aVHillary Clinton's short speech is pandering to the worst instincts in our society.
p1819
aVShe should be ashamed of herself!
p1820
aVI had a great meeting with African-American and Latino leaders this morning at Trump Tower in NYC.
p1821
aVI am grateful for their time, feedback, and support.
p1822
aVIt is being reported by virtually everyone, and is a fact, that the media pile on against me is the worst in American political history!
p1823
aVOur MOVEMENT will WIN - in November!
p1824
aVVOTE!
p1825
aVThere is only one way to end the corruption in our country!

aVThank you to our amazing law enforcement officers and first responders as well - all across America!
p1840
aVI am at the Florida State Fairgrounds- and just received some great poll information.

aVWe are going to declare our independence from failures of the past and create a New American Future.
p1851
aVOnce again, we will have a government of, by, and for the people.
p1852
aVAmericanism, not globalism, will be our credo.

aVMAYOR RUDY GIULIANI STATEMENT ON LATEST CLINTON FOUNDATION DONOR SCANDAL:                           (New York, NY) \u2013 Former New York City Mayor and U.S. Attorney Rudy Giuliani today released the following statement on the Associated Press' analysis revealing that 55 percent of Hillary Clinton's non-government meetings while at the State Department were Clinton Foundation donors whose contributions totaled at least $156 million:   "From the facts revealed to-date, it is impossible to figure out where the Clinton Foundation ends and the State Department begins.
p1857
aVIt is now abundantly clear that the Clintons set up a business to profit from public office.
p1858
aVThey sold access and specific actions by and to them for money.
p1859
aVThis makes a mockery of her promise to Congress and the President to keep the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton State Department entirely separate.
p1860
aVIn other words, they merged the two into the Clinton Family racketeering enterprise.
p1861
aVThe need for a Special Prosecutor to investigate these apparent crimes mounts with every passing day and the revelation of new sets of e-mails and phone logs.
p1862
aVI'm sure all we've seen is the tip of the iceberg and there will be more to follow."
p1863
aV-Rudy Giuliani
p1864
aVGreat seeing our AMAZING BORDER PATROL AGENTS this afternoon in Austin, Texas!
p1865
aVI am grateful for their endorsement, along with 16,500 of their fellow AGENTS - to be your next PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!
p1866
aVI will not let you down!

aVGOVERNOR MIKE PENCE STATEMENT ON AP CLINTON FOUNDATION EXPOS:  "The fact Hillary Clinton's official schedule was full of meetings with Clinton Foundation donors is further evidence of the pay-to-play politics at her State Department.
p1869
aVNo one is above the law.
p1870
aVThe Clinton Foundation must be immediately shut down and an independent special prosecutor be appointed to determine if access to Hillary Clinton was for sale.
p1871
aVIt would be a dereliction of duty by President Obama and his Justice Department if they fail to act on these startling new facts right now."
p1872
aV-Governor Mike Pence
p1873
aVIT IS TIME TO VOTE FOR A NEW AMERICAN FUTURE!
p1874
aV-Donald J. Trump
p1875
aVPresident Obama should have gone to Louisiana days ago, instead of golfing.
p1876
aVToo little, too late!

aVAKRON, OHIO SPEECH  It's so great to be in Ohio.
p1880
aVI love this state \u2013 where I once worked \u2013 and I love the people of this state.
p1881
aVI have a message for all of you tonight: we are going to win Ohio, we are going to win the White House, and we are going to bring back your jobs.
p1882
aVWe are going to negotiate fair trade deals that put American workers first.
p1883
aVWe are going to stop the product dumping, the unfair foreign subsidies, and the currency manipulation.
p1884
aVWe are going to stop the foreign cheating.
p1885
aVThe era of economic surrender is over.
p1886
aVA new era of American Greatness is beginning.
p1887
aVNo state has been hurt worse by the Hillary Clinton trade policies than Ohio.
p1888
aVHillary Clinton backed her husband's NAFTA, she backed China's entrance into the World Trade Organization, she backed the job-killing trade deal with South Korea, and backed the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
p1889
aVOne bad deal after another.
p1890
aVHillary Clinton's donors own her, and she will do whatever they tell her to do.
p1891
aVOhio and the Akron area have lost nearly 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA.
p1892
aVThis region and this state have lost nearly 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs since China entered the World Trade Organization.
p1893
aVOur trade deficit in goods with the world is now nearly $800 billion dollars.
p1894
aVThis subtracts directly from our growth \u2013 our economy grew only 1.2 percent in the last quarter, a total disaster.
p1895
aVThis is the legacy of Obama-Clinton.
p1896
aVI am promising a new legacy for America.
p1897
aVWe are going to create a New American Future.
p1898
aVBut to do that, we have to stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
p1899
aVOur trade deficit with the proposed TPP member countries cost the state of Ohio more than 100,000 manufacturing jobs last year.
p1900
aVImagine how many more jobs would be lost if TPP was actually approved.
p1901
aVHillary Clinton, who called the TPP the "Gold Standard", would 100% approve it if she ever got in.
p1902
aVHer closest friend, Terry McAuliffe, confirmed that she would.
p1903
aVWe won't let that happen.
p1904
aVWe will win this election, and we will keep America out of the TPP.
p1905
aVWe will defend our freedom, our jobs, and our economic independence.
p1906
aVIt's going to be America First.
p1907
aVMy economic plan is going to grow this economy, raise your wages, and create millions of new jobs.
p1908
aVHere are a few of the things we will do: A massive tax cut for working Americans, and a 15% tax rate for small businesses.
p1909
aVWe are going to eliminate regulations that kill American jobs, and that includes getting rid of the Obama Administration's new anti-energy rules that will raise Ohio energy bills by more than 40 percent.
p1910
aVThese Obama-Clinton energy restrictions are a tax on the poor, and they devastate low-income African-American and Latino workers.
p1911
aVOhio gets 60% of its electricity from coal-powered energy.
p1912
aVHillary Clinton says she wants to "put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business."
p1913
aVJust like she wants to put the steel workers out of business.
p1914
aVWe are going to put the miners and the steel workers back to work \u2013 and we are going to get your energy bills down.
p1915
aVWe are going to repeal and replace Obamacare, saving another 2 million jobs over the next decade.
p1916
aVAnother major part of our agenda is law and order.
p1917
aVMore than 2,600 have been shot in Chicago alone since the beginning of this year.
p1918
aVThis is one of the biggest differences between me and my opponent.
p1919
aVI believe that safety is a right that belongs to all Americans.
p1920
aVLet me take this opportunity to thank the law enforcement officers here in this city, and across this country, for their service and sacrifice in difficult times.
p1921
aVWorking with communities and police, I pledge to bring safety to communities across this land \u2013 but especially to those places that have not known safety in a very, very long time.
p1922
aVI want every parent and child in this society \u2013 including every African-American and Hispanic citizen \u2013 to be able to live in a safe, thriving and prosperous community.
p1923
aVThis is the New American Future that we are working together to create.
p1924
aVHillary Clinton is the past.
p1925
aVWe are the future.
p1926
aVAnother major part of our agenda is immigration security.
p1927
aVWe need to protect American jobs.
p1928
aVWe need to protect American safety.
p1929
aVLow-income workers are hurt the most by my opponent's policies.
p1930
aVPoor Hispanic and African-American citizens are the first to lose a job, or see a pay cut, when we don't control our borders.
p1931
aVAccording to Pew Research, immigration over the next fifty years will add another 100 million to our population.
p1932
aVIt will be much, much more than even that under Hillary Clinton's radical plans.
p1933
aVThat's unfair to the low-income workers \u2013 African-American, Latino, all Americans \u2013 living here today and trying to get ahead.
p1934
aVHillary Clinton has forgotten the first rule of public service.
p1935
aVThe job of an elected official is to serve the citizens of the United States.
p1936
aVIf you don't understand that, then you cannot run for President.
p1937
aVIf you are not prepared to put American workers first, then you should not hold or seek public office.
p1938
aVIt's just that simple.
p1939
aVNo issue better illustrates how corrupt my opponent is than her pay-for-play scandals as Secretary of State.
p1940
aVAs the evidence has become public over the last several months, I have become increasingly shocked by the vast scope of Hillary Clinton's criminality.
p1941
aV\ufffdHillary Clinton said she turned over all of her work related emails.
p1942
aVShe testified that to Congress under penalty of perjury.
p1943
aVNow we learn about another 15,000 emails she failed to turn over have just been discovered.
p1944
aVColin Powell just proved again how dishonest Hillary Clinton is after he busted her for trying to pin her email scandal on him \u2013 one more Hillary Clinton lie.
p1945
aVHer Foundation took in large payments from major corporations and wealthy individuals, foreign and domestic, all while she was Secretary of State.
p1946
aVThe Clinton Foundation accepted as much as $60 million dollars from Middle Eastern countries that oppress women, gays and people of different faiths.
p1947
aVThe Foundation donors included corporations and individuals with significant matters before the State Department.
p1948
aVAnd then either Hillary Clinton herself or one of her closest aides took action favorable to the donor.
p1949
aVHer actions corrupted and disgraced one of the most important Departments of government, indeed one of only four established by the United States Constitution itself.
p1950
aVThe Clintons' made the State Department into the same kind of Pay-to-Play operations as the Arkansas Government was: pay the Clinton Foundation huge sums of money and throw in some big speaking fees for Bill Clinton and you got to play with the State Department.
p1951
aVThe amounts involved, the favors done and the significant numbers of times it was done require an expedited investigation by a Special Prosecutor.
p1952
aVAfter the FBI and Department of Justice whitewash of the Clinton email crimes, they certainly cannot be trusted to quickly or impartially investigate Hillary Clinton's crimes.
p1953
aVSome former prosecutors have even suggested that the coordination between the pay-for-play State Department and the corrupt Clinton Foundation constitute a clear example of a RICO (Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organization) enterprise.
p1954
aVThe Justice Department is required to appoint an independent Special Prosecutor because it has proven itself to be a political arm of the White House.
p1955
aVThe DOJ has acted very unethically, particularly the Attorney General's private lengthy meeting with Bill Clinton shortly before the Department's decision not to prosecute her for crimes that would have been prosecuted against almost any other citizen.
p1956
aVIf the Justice Department fails to do so, it will make it even clearer that a second of the four primary constitutional Departments have been corrupted.
p1957
aVHere is one example of Clinton Corruption.
p1958
aVAs Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton signed off on a deal allowing Russians to take an increased stake in a company called Uranium One, giving up control of about 20 percent of America's uranium supply to the Russians.
p1959
aVClinton's approval of the deal netted the owners of the uranium company millions of dollars.
p1960
aVIn exchange for signing off on the deal, some of the former owners of Uranium One gave the Clinton Foundation millions of dollars in donations.
p1961
aVIn addition, Bill Clinton received $500,000 for a speech to a Kremlin-backed investment firm that was a beneficiary of the deal.
p1962
aV\ufffdHere is another example of pay-for-play.
p1963
aV\ufffdIn 2009, Ericsson telecommunications came under U.S. pressure for selling telecom equipment to several oppressive governments \u2013 including Sudan, Syria, and Iran.
p1964
aVSome these regimes used those technologies to monitor and control their own people.
p1965
aVIn June 2011, Hillary Clinton's State Department began adding goods and services to a list that might be covered under expanded sanctions on Iran and other state sponsors of terrorism.
p1966
aVDuring that time, Ericsson sponsored a speech by Bill Clinton, paying him $750,000 \u2013 his highest paying speech.
p1967
aVIn April 2012, the Obama Administration issued an executive order imposing sanctions on telecom sales to Iran and Syria \u2013but those sanctions did not cover Ericsson's work in Iran.
p1968
aVA Trump Administration will end the government corruption.
p1969
aVNo one will be above the law.
p1970
aVWe will have one set of rules for everyone.
p1971
aVIn Hillary Clinton's world, we have one set of rules for her \u2013 and another set of rules for everyone else.
p1972
aVI am fighting for everyone who doesn't have a voice.
p1973
aVThe forgotten men and women of America.
p1974
aVI am your voice.
p1975
aVHillary Clinton's campaign is funded by Wall Street and hedge fund managers.
p1976
aVMy campaign is powered by my own money, but also by small dollar donations from working people across this country who want their country back.
p1977
aVNothing terrifies the ruling class more than when everyday working people give 5, 10, or 15 dollars to our campaign to help us take government away from the special interests and give it back to the voters.
p1978
aVCome November 8th, we are once again going to have a government that serves you, your family, and your country.
p1979
aVWe are going to rebuild our depleted military, avoid needless foreign wars, build new friendships overseas, and remember those three famous words: Peace Through Strength.
p1980
aVWe are going to work with our allies to crush, defeat, and utterly destroy ISIS.
p1981
aVWe are going to have a new immigration screening test to keep people out of our country who don't support our tolerant values.
p1982
aVWe are also going to reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton, who sees people of color only as votes and not as human beings worthy of a better future.
p1983
aVThe Democratic Party has run nearly every inner city for half a century or more.
p1984
aVThey have produced only more poverty, failing schools, and broken homes.
p1985
aVIn the last eight years, the African-American labor force participation has declined another 3 percentage points \u2013 and it's dropped another 6 percent for teenagers.
p1986
aVNearly 4 in 10 African-American children live in poverty.
p1987
aVAfrican-American home ownership has declined nearly ten percentage points.
p1988
aVMeanwhile, since 2009, another 2 million Latinos have fallen into poverty.
p1989
aVIncomes for Latino workers fell by almost another $1,000 dollars.
p1990
aVMeanwhile, homicides are up nearly 50 percent in Washington D.C. and more than 60 percent in Baltimore.
p1991
aVThe level of crime in these cities is something no American should consider acceptable.
p1992
aVOur government has failed these residents.
p1993
aVFor those hurting the most \u2013 who have been failed again and again by their politicians \u2013 I've asked in recent days, what do you have to lose by trying something new?
p1994
aVIf you keep voting for the same failed politicians you will keep getting the same results.
p1995
aVBut, most importantly, I want to talk about what you have to gain.
p1996
aVThose hurting in our county have so much to gain by joining our campaign for a new, and more inclusive, American Future.
p1997
aVMy tax reforms will add millions of new jobs and thousands of new small businesses.
p1998
aVMy energy reforms will create millions of new jobs and lower the price of your energy bill.
p1999
aVMy trade reforms will raise wages, grow jobs and add trillions in new wealth into our country.
p2000
aVMy immigration reforms will protect your jobs and stop businesses from exploiting visa programs that hurt poor workers.
p2001
aVMy infrastructure plans will rebuild your roads, bridges and airports.
p2002
aVMy regulatory reforms will make it easier for African-Americans small businesses to thrive, and for young children to live out their dreams.
p2003
aVMy promise of school choice, charter schools and merit-pay for teachers will help low-income students in our inner cities.
p2004
aVHillary Clinton discriminates against poor African-American children by opposing school choice.
p2005
aVMy government reforms will make your voice heard \u2013 not the voice of the special interests.
p2006
aVEvery insider, getting rich off of our broken system, is throwing money at Hillary Clinton.
p2007
aVIt's the powerful protecting the powerful.
p2008
aVInsiders fighting for insiders.
p2009
aVI am fighting for you.
p2010
aVEvery day you turn on the nightly news, you hear about how some self-interested banker or some Washington insider says they oppose our campaign.
p2011
aVOr some encrusted old politician says they oppose our campaign.
p2012
aVOr some big time lobbyist says they oppose our campaign.
p2013
aVI wear their opposition as a badge of honor.
p2014
aVBecause it means I am fighting for REAL change, not just partisan change.
p2015
aVI am fighting \u2013 all of us across the country are fighting \u2013 for peaceful regime change in our own country.
p2016
aVThe media-donor-political complex that's bled this country dry has to be replaced with a new government of, by and for the people.
p2017
aVI will fight to ensure that every American is treated equally, protected equally, and honored equally.
p2018
aVWe will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms, and seek a new future of security, prosperity and opportunity \u2013 a future built on our common culture and values as one American people.
p2019
aVI am asking for your vote so I can be your champion in the White House.
p2020
aVTo every parent who dreams for their children, and to every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I'm with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you.

aVDONALD J. TRUMP STATEMENT ON CLINTON FOUNDATION: SHUT IT DOWN  Hillary Clinton is the defender of the corrupt and rigged status quo.
p2045
aVThe Clintons have spent decades as insiders lining their own pockets and taking care of donors instead of the American people.
p2046
aVIt is now clear that the Clinton Foundation is the most corrupt enterprise in political history.
p2047
aVWhat they were doing during Crooked Hillary's time as Secretary of State was wrong then, and it is wrong now.
p2048
aVIt must be shut down immediately.

aVBUILDING A NEW AMERICAN FUTURE:  Thank you.
p2090
aVIt's great to be here in Charlotte.
p2091
aVI just met with our many amazing employees right up the road at our property.
p2092
aVI'd like to take a moment to talk about the heartbreak and devastation in Louisiana, a state that is very special to me.
p2093
aVWe are one nation.
p2094
aVWhen one state hurts, we all hurt \u2013 and we must all work together to lift each other up.
p2095
aVWorking, building, restoring together.
p2096
aVOur prayers are with the families who have lost loved ones, and we send them our deepest condolences.
p2097
aVThough words cannot express the sadness one feels at times like this, I hope everyone in Louisiana knows that our country is praying for them and standing with them to help them in these difficult hours.
p2098
aVWe are one country, one people, and we will have together one great future.
p2099
aVTonight, I'd like to talk about the New American Future we are going to create together.
p2100
aVLast week, I laid out my plan to bring jobs back to our country.
p2101
aVOn Monday, I laid out my plan to defeat Radical Islamic Terrorism.
p2102
aVOn Tuesday, in Wisconsin, I talked about how we are going to restore law and order to this country.
p2103
aVLet me take this opportunity to extend our thanks and our gratitude to the police and law enforcement officers in this country who have sacrificed so greatly in these difficult times.
p2104
aVThe chaos and violence on our streets, and the assaults on law enforcement, are an attack against all peaceful citizens.
p2105
aVIf I am elected President, this chaos and violence will end \u2013 and it will end very quickly.
p2106
aVEvery single citizen in our land has a right to live in safety.
p2107
aVTo be one united nation, we must protect all of our people.
p2108
aVBut we must also provide opportunities for all of our people.
p2109
aVWe cannot make America Great Again if we leave any community behind.
p2110
aVNearly Four in ten African-American children are living in poverty.I will not rest until children of every color in this country are fully included in the American Dream.
p2111
aVJobs, safety, opportunity.
p2112
aVFair and equal representation.
p2113
aVThis is what I promise to African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and all Americans.
p2114
aVBut to achieve this New American Future we must break from the failures of the past.
p2115
aVAs you know, I am not a politician.
p2116
aVI have worked in business, creating jobs and rebuilding neighborhoods my entire adult life.
p2117
aVI've never wanted to use the language of the insiders, and I've never been politically correct \u2013 it takes far too much time, and can often make more difficult.
p2118
aVSometimes, in the heat of debate and speaking on a multitude of issues, you don't choose the right words or you say the wrong thing.
p2119
aVI have done that, and I regret it, particularly where it may have caused personal pain.
p2120
aVToo much is at stake for us to be consumed with these issues.
p2121
aVBut one thing I can promise you is this: I will always tell you the truth.
p2122
aVI speak the truth for all of you, and for everyone in this country who doesn't have a voice.
p2123
aVI speak the truth on behalf of the factory worker who lost his or her job.
p2124
aVI speak the truth on behalf of the Veteran who has been denied the medical care they need \u2013 and so many are not making it.
p2125
aVThey are dying.
p2126
aVI speak the truth on behalf of the family living near the border that deserves to be safe in their own country but is instead living with no security at all.
p2127
aVOur campaign is about representing the great majority of Americans \u2013 Republicans, Democrats, Independents, Conservatives and Liberals \u2013 who read the newspaper, or turn on the TV, and don't hear anyone speaking for them.
p2128
aVAll they hear are insiders fighting for insiders.
p2129
aVThese are the forgotten men and women in our society, and they are angry at so much on so many levels.
p2130
aVThe poverty, the unemployment, the failing schools, the jobs moving to other countries.
p2131
aVI am fighting for these forgotten Americans.
p2132
aVFourteen months ago, I declared my campaign for the Presidency on the promise to give our government back to the people.
p2133
aVEvery day since then, I've worked to repay the loyalty and the faith that you have put in me.
p2134
aVEvery day I think about how much is at stake for this country.
p2135
aVThis isn't just the fight of my life, it's the fight of our lives \u2013 together \u2013 to save our country.
p2136
aVI refuse to let another generation of American children be excluded from the American Dream.
p2137
aVOur whole country loses when young people of limitless potential are denied the opportunity to contribute their talents because we failed to provide them the opportunities they deserved.
p2138
aVLet our children be dreamers too.
p2139
aVOur whole country loses every time a kid doesn't graduate from high school, or fails to enter the workforce or, worse still, is lost to the dreadful world of drugs and crime.
p2140
aVWhen I look at the failing schools, the terrible trade deals, and the infrastructure crumbling in our inner cities, I know all of this can be fixed - and it can be fixed very quickly.
p2141
aVIn the world I come from, if something is broken, you fix it.
p2142
aVIf something isn't working, you replace it.
p2143
aVIf a product doesn't deliver, you make a change.
p2144
aVI have no patience for injustice, no tolerance for government incompetence, no sympathy for leaders who fail their citizens.
p2145
aVThat's why I am running: to end the decades of bitter failure and to offer the American people a new future of honesty, justice and opportunity.
p2146
aVA future where America, and its people, always \u2013 and I mean always \u2013 come first.
p2147
aVAren't you tired of a system that gets rich at your expense?
p2148
aVAren't you tired of the same old lies and the same old broken promises?
p2149
aVAnd Hillary Clinton has proven to be one of the greatest liars of all time.
p2150
aVAren't you tired of arrogant leaders who look down on you, instead of serving and protecting you?
p2151
aVThat is all about to change \u2013 and it's about to change soon.
p2152
aVWe are going to put the American people first again.
p2153
aVI've travelled all across this country laying out my bold and modern agenda for change.
p2154
aVIn this journey, I will never lie to you.
p2155
aVI will never tell you something I do not believe.
p2156
aVI will never put anyone's interests ahead of yours.
p2157
aVAnd, I will never, ever stop fighting for you.
p2158
aVI have no special interest.
p2159
aVI am spending millions of dollars on my own campaign \u2013 nobody else is.
p2160
aVMy only interest is the American people.
p2161
aVSo while sometimes I can be too honest, Hillary Clinton is the exact opposite: she never tells the truth.
p2162
aVOne lie after another, and getting worse each passing day.
p2163
aVThe American people are still waiting for Hillary Clinton to apologize for all of the many lies she's told to them, and the many times she's betrayed them.
p2164
aVTell me, has Hillary Clinton ever apologized for lying about her illegal email server and deleting 33,000 emails?
p2165
aVHas Hillary Clinton apologized for turning the State Department into a pay-for-play operation where favors are sold to the highest bidder?
p2166
aVHas she apologized for lying to the families who lost loved ones at Benghazi?
p2167
aVHas she apologized for putting Iran on the path to nuclear weapons?
p2168
aVHas she apologized for Iraq?
p2169
aVFor Libya?
p2170
aVFor Syria?
p2171
aVHas she apologized for unleashing ISIS across the world?
p2172
aVHas Hillary Clinton apologized for the decisions she made that have led to so much death, destruction and terrorism?
p2173
aVSpeaking of lies, we now know from the State Department announcement that President Obama lied about the $400 million dollars in cash that was flown to Iran.
p2174
aVHe denied it was for the hostages, but it was.
p2175
aVHe said we don't pay ransom, but he did.
p2176
aVHe lied about the hostages \u2013 openly and blatantly \u2013 just like he lied about Obamacare.
p2177
aVNow the Administration has put every American travelling overseas, including our military personnel, at greater risk of being kidnapped.
p2178
aVHillary Clinton owns President Obama's Iran policy, one more reason she can never be allowed to be President.
p2179
aVLet's talk about the economy.
p2180
aVHere, in this beautiful state, so many people have suffered because of NAFTA.
p2181
aVBill Clinton signed the deal, and Hillary Clinton supported it.
p2182
aVNorth Carolina has lost nearly half of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA went into effect.
p2183
aVBill Clinton also put China into the World Trade Organization \u2013 another Hillary Clinton-backed deal.
p2184
aVYour city of Charlotte has lost 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs since China joined the WTO, and many of these jobs were lost while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State \u2013 our chief diplomat with China.
p2185
aVShe was a disaster, totally unfit for the job.
p2186
aVHillary Clinton owes the State of North Carolina a very big apology, and I think you'll get that apology around the same time you'll get to see her 33,000 deleted emails.
p2187
aVAnother major issue in this campaign has been the border.
p2188
aVOur open border has allowed drugs and crime and gangs to pour into our communities.
p2189
aVSo much needless suffering, so much preventable death.
p2190
aVI've spent time with the families of wonderful Americans whose loved ones were killed by the open borders and Sanctuary Cities that Hillary Clinton supports.
p2191
aVI've embraced the crying parents who've lost their children to violence spilling across our border.
p2192
aVParents like Laura Wilkerson and Michelle Root and Sabine Durden and Jamiel Shaw whose children were killed by illegal immigrants.
p2193
aVMy opponent supports Sanctuary Cities.
p2194
aVBut where was the Sanctuary for Kate Steinle?
p2195
aVWhere was the Sanctuary for the children of Laura, Michelle, Sabine and Jamiel?
p2196
aVWhere was the Sanctuary for every other parent who has suffered so horribly?
p2197
aVThese moms and dads don't get a lot of consideration from our politicians.
p2198
aVThey certainly don't get apologies.
p2199
aVThey'll never even get the time of day from Hillary Clinton.
p2200
aVBut they will always come first to me.
p2201
aVListen closely: we will deliver justice for all of these American Families.
p2202
aVWe will create a system of immigration that makes us all proud.
p2203
aVHillary Clinton's mistakes destroy innocent lives, sacrifice national security, and betray the working families of this country.
p2204
aVPlease remember this: I will never put personal profit before national security.
p2205
aVI will never leave our border open to appease donors and special interests.
p2206
aVI will never support a trade deal that kills American jobs.
p2207
aVI will never put the special interests before the national interest.
p2208
aVI will never put a donor before a voter, or a lobbyist before a citizen.
p2209
aVInstead, I will be a champion for the people.
p2210
aVThe establishment media doesn't cover what really matters in this country, or what's really going on in people's lives.
p2211
aVThey will take words of mine out of context and spend a week obsessing over every single syllable, and then pretend to discover some hidden meaning in what I said.
p2212
aVJust imagine for a second if the media spent this energy holding the politicians accountable who got innocent Americans like Kate Steinle killed \u2013 she was gunned down by an illegal immigrant who had been deported five times.
p2213
aVJust imagine if the media spent this much time investigating the poverty and joblessness in our inner cities.
p2214
aVJust think about how much different things would be if the media in this country sent their cameras to our border, or to our closing factories, or to our failing schools.
p2215
aVOr if the media focused on what dark secrets must be hidden in the 33,000 emails Hillary Clinton deleted.
p2216
aVInstead, every story is told from the perspective of the insiders.
p2217
aVIt's the narrative of the people who rigged the system, never the voice of the people it's been rigged against.
p2218
aVSo many people suffering in silence.
p2219
aVNo cameras, no coverage, no outrage from a media class that seems to get outraged over just about everything else.
p2220
aVSo again, it's not about me.
p2221
aVIt's never been about me.
p2222
aVIt's about all the people in this country who don't have a voice.
p2223
aVI am running to be their voice.
p2224
aVI am running to be the voice for every forgotten part of this country that has been waiting and hoping for a better future.
p2225
aVI am glad that I make the powerful a little uncomfortable now and again \u2013 including some powerful people in my own party.
p2226
aVBecause it means I am fighting for real change.
p2227
aVThere's a reason the hedge fund managers, the financial lobbyists, the Wall Street investors, are throwing their money at Hillary Clinton.
p2228
aVBecause they know she will make sure the system stays rigged in their favor.
p2229
aVIt's the powerful protecting the powerful.
p2230
aVThe insiders fighting for the insiders.
p2231
aVI am fighting for you.
p2232
aVHere is the change I propose.
p2233
aVOn terrorism, we are going to end the era of nation-building and instead focus on destroying ISIS and Radical Islamic terrorism.
p2234
aVWe will use military, cyber and financial warfare and work with any partner in the world, and the Middle East, that shares our goal of defeating terrorism.
p2235
aVI have a message for the terrorists trying to kill our citizens: we will find you, we will destroy you, and we will win.
p2236
aVOn immigration, we will temporarily suspend immigration from any place where adequate screening cannot be performed.
p2237
aVAll applicants for immigration will be vetted for ties to radical ideology, and we will screen out anyone who doesn't share our values and love our people.
p2238
aVAnyone who believes Sharia law supplants American law will not be given an immigrant visa.
p2239
aVIf you want to join our society, then you must embrace our society, our values and our tolerant way of life.
p2240
aVThose who believe in oppressing women, gays, Hispanics, African-Americans and people of different faiths are not welcome to join our country.
p2241
aVWe will promote our America values, our American way of life, and our American system of government which are all the best in the world.
p2242
aVMy opponent on the other hand wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees.
p2243
aVHer plan would bring in roughly 620,000 refugees from all refugee-sending nations in her first term, on top of all other immigration.
p2244
aVHillary Clinton is running to be America's Angela Merkel, and we've seen how much crime and how many problems that's caused the German people.
p2245
aVWe have enough problems already, we don't need another one.
p2246
aVOn crime, we are going to add more police, more investigators, and appoint the best judges and prosecutors in the world.
p2247
aVWe will pursue strong enforcement of federal laws.
p2248
aVThe gangs and cartels and criminal syndicates terrorizing our people will be stripped apart one by one.
p2249
aVTheir day is over.
p2250
aVOn trade, we are going to renegotiate NAFTA, withdraw from the TPP, stand up to China on our terrible trade agreement, and protect every last American job.
p2251
aVHillary Clinton has supported all of the major trade deals that have stripped this country of its jobs and its wealth.
p2252
aVOn taxes, we are going to massively cut tax rates for workers and small businesses \u2013 creating millions of new good paying jobs.
p2253
aVWe are going to get rid of regulations that send jobs overseas and we are going to make it easier for young Americans to get the credit they need to start a small business and pursue their dreams.
p2254
aVOn education, we are going to give students choice, and allow charter schools to thrive.
p2255
aVWe are going to end tenure policies that reward bad teachers and hurt good ones.
p2256
aVMy opponent wants to deny students choice and opportunity, all to get a little bit more money from the education bureaucracy.
p2257
aVShe doesn't care how many young dreams are dashed in the process.
p2258
aVWe are going to work closely with African-American parents and students in the inner cities \u2013 and what a big difference that will make.
p2259
aVThis means a lot to me, and it is going to be a top priority in a Trump Administration.
p2260
aVOn healthcare, we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare.
p2261
aVCountless Americans have been forced into part-time jobs, premiums are about to jump by double-digits yet again, and just this week Aetna announced it is pulling out of the exchanges in North Carolina.
p2262
aVWe are going to replace this disaster with reforms that give you choice and freedom and control in healthcare \u2013 at a much lower cost.
p2263
aVOn political corruption, we are going to restore honor to our government.
p2264
aVIn my Administration, I am going to enforce all laws concerning the protection of classified information.
p2265
aVNo one will be above the law.
p2266
aVI am going to forbid senior officials from trading favors for cash by preventing them from collecting lavish speaking fees through their spouses when they serve.
p2267
aVI am going to ask my senior officials to sign an agreement not to accept speaking fees from corporations with a registered lobbyist for five years after leaving office, or from any entity tied to a foreign government.
p2268
aVFinally, we are going to bring this country together.
p2269
aVWe are going to do it by emphasizing what we all have in common as Americans.
p2270
aVWe are going to reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton, which sees communities of color only as votes and not as human beings worthy of a better future.
p2271
aVIf African-American voters give Donald Trump a chance by giving me their vote, the result for them will be amazing.
p2272
aVLook at how badly things are going under decades of Democratic leadership \u2013 look at the schools, look at the 58% of young African-Americans not working.
p2273
aVIt is time for change.
p2274
aVWhat do you have to lose by trying something new?
p2275
aV\u2013 I will fix it.
p2276
aVThis means so much to me, and I will work as hard as I can to bring new opportunity to places in our country which have not known opportunity in a very long time.
p2277
aVHillary Clinton and the Democratic Party have taken African-American votes totally for granted.
p2278
aVBecause the votes have been automatically there, there has been no reason for Democrats to produce.
p2279
aVIt is time to break with the failures of the past, and to fight for every last American child in this country to have the better future they deserve.
p2280
aVIn my Administration, every American will be treated equally, protected equally, and honored equally.
p2281
aVWe will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms, and seek a new future built on our common culture and values as one American people.
p2282
aVThis is the change I am promising all of you: an honest government, a fair economy, and a just society for each and every American.
p2283
aVBut we can never fix our problems by relying on the same politicians who created these problems in the first place.
p2284
aV72% of voters say our country is on the wrong track.
p2285
aVI am the change candidate, Hillary Clinton is the failed status quo.
p2286
aVIt is time to vote for a New American Future.
p2287
aVTogether, We Will Make America Strong Again.
p2288
aVWe Will Make American Proud Again.
p2289
aVWe Will Make America Safe Again.
p2290
aVFriends and fellow citizens: Come November, We Will Make America Great Again.
p2291
aVThank You, And God Bless.

aVCrooked Hillary Clinton #ThrowbackThursday:
p2293
aVDonald Trump delivered one of the most avowedly conservative speeches America has heard in 50 years, contending for the Democratic votes, minority votes and inner city votes.
p2294
aVIt was a masterpiece.'
p2295
aVByron York: 'Asking for black votes, a very different Donald Trump' | CBS News' Major Garrett tweeted, "Having been listening since August 2015, objectively best drafted & best delivered Trump speech of campaign.
p2296
aVWill resonate."
p2297
aVNext time you hear that Trump's proposal for immigrant vetting is un-American, the correct response is that it is American to its core.
p2298
aVAnd the next time you hear that Trump's proposal is crazier than crazy, the correct response is that\u2014given the mess the world is in\u2014it is the notion that we should not vet immigrants more carefully that is certifiably insane.'
p2299
aVI AM FIGHTING FOR YOU!

aV#ImWithYou #AmericaFirst
p2301
aVThis afternoon - I hosted a very informative national security roundtable at Trump Tower.
p2302
aVI can assure you -- with a Trump Administration, we will make the safety & security of our nation a top priority.
p2303
aVWe will MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN!
p2304
aVDonald J. Trump
p2305
aVIt is time for rule by the PEOPLE, not rule by SPECIAL INTERESTS!
p2306
aVDonald Trumps National Security Speech was very Reaganesque.
p2307
aVAfter all, long before he became president, Mr. Reagan warned that every generation faces an existential threat to freedom.'
p2308
aVDonald Trump's foreign policy statement is rock solid.
p2309
aVIt reflects state-of-the-art knowledge on counterterrorism.
p2310
aVI can't, actually, find anything to disagree with.'
p2311
aV-Dr. Cheryl Benard
p2312
aVI have been saying it from the beginning.
p2313
aVObamacare is a total disaster!
p2314
aVAnother major health insurer is pulling their coverage.
p2315
aVIf I am elected your next President, I will repeal & replace Obamacare- IMMEDIATELY!

aV#LawAndOrder #ImWithYou
p2318
aVIt's so great to be here tonight.
p2319
aVI am honored to also be joined this evening by Governor Scott Walker, Chairman Reince Prebius, and Mayor Rudy Giuliani.
p2320
aVWe are at a decisive moment in this election.
p2321
aVLast week, I laid out my plan to bring jobs back to our country.
p2322
aVYesterday, I laid out my plan to defeat Radical Islamic Terrorism.
p2323
aVTonight, I am going to talk about how to make our communities safe again from crime and lawlessness.
p2324
aVLet me begin by thanking the law enforcement officers here in this city, and across this country, for their service and sacrifice in difficult times.
p2325
aVThe violence, riots and destruction that have taken place in Milwaukee is an assault on the right of all citizens to live in security and peace.
p2326
aVLaw and order must be restored.
p2327
aVIt must be restored for the sake of all, but most especially the sake of those living in the affected communities.
p2328
aVThe main victims of these riots are law-abiding African-American citizens living in these neighborhoods.
p2329
aVIt is their jobs, their homes, their schools and communities which will suffer as a result.
p2330
aVThere is no compassion in tolerating lawless conduct.
p2331
aVCrime and violence is an attack on the poor, and will never be accepted in a Trump Administration.
p2332
aVThe narrative that has been pushed aggressively for years now by our current Administration, and pushed by my opponent Hillary Clinton, is a false one.
p2333
aVThe problem in our poorest communities is not that there are too many police, the problem is that there are not enough police.
p2334
aVMore law enforcement, more community engagement, more effective policing is what our country needs.
p2335
aVJust like Hillary Clinton is against the miners, she is against the police.
p2336
aVYou know it, and I know it.
p2337
aVThose peddling the narrative of cops as a racist force in our society \u2013 a narrative supported with a nod by my opponent \u2013 share directly in the responsibility for the unrest in Milwaukee, and many other places within our country.
p2338
aVThey have fostered the dangerous anti-police atmosphere in America.
p2339
aVEverytime we rush to judgment with false facts and narratives \u2013 whether in Ferguson or in Baltimore \u2013 and foment further unrest, we do a direct disservice to poor African-American residents who are hurt by the high crime in their communities.
p2340
aVDuring the last 72 hours, while protestors have raged against the police here in Milwaukee, another 9 were killed in Chicago and another 46 were wounded.
p2341
aVMore than 2,600 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year, and almost 4,000 killed in President Obama's hometown area since his presidency began.
p2342
aVHow are we serving these American victims by attacking law enforcement officers?
p2343
aVThe war on our police must end.
p2344
aVIt must end now!
p2345
aVThe war on our police is a war on all peaceful citizens who want to be able to work and live and send their kids to school in safety.
p2346
aVOur job is not to make life more comfortable for the rioter, the looter, the violent disruptor.
p2347
aVOur job is to make life more comfortable for the African-American parent who wants their kids to be able to safely walk the streets.
p2348
aVOr the senior citizen waiting for a bus.
p2349
aVOr the young child walking home from school.
p2350
aVFor every one violent protestor, there are a hundred of moms and dads and kids on that same city block who just want to be able to sleep safely at night.
p2351
aVMy opponent would rather protect the offender than the victim.
p2352
aVHillary Clinton-backed policies are responsible for the problems in the inner cities today, and a vote for her is a vote for another generation of poverty, high crime, and lost opportunities.
p2353
aVI care too much about my country to let that happen.
p2354
aVWe all care too much about our country to let that happen.
p2355
aVGood policing saves lives.
p2356
aVMy dear friend, Rudy Giuliani, knows a thing or two about this.
p2357
aVThe policies put into place by Rudy ultimately brought down crime by 76 percent and murder by 84 percent.
p2358
aVThink of how many families were saved, how much heartache was prevented, when police were put into communities and criminals were removed.
p2359
aVImagine how many lives could have been saved, all across this country, if Democratic politicians hadn't blocked in their cities what Rudy did in New York City?
p2360
aVI'll make sure we deliver safe neighborhoods here in Milwaukee, and all across this country.
p2361
aVIt's easy for Hillary Clinton to turn a blind eye to crime when she has her own private security force.
p2362
aVI believe all Americans, not just the powerful, are entitled to security.
p2363
aVHillary Clinton has had her chance.
p2364
aVShe failed.
p2365
aVNow it's time for new leadership.
p2366
aVThe Hillary Clinton agenda hurts poor people the most.
p2367
aVThere is no compassion in allowing drug dealers, gang members, and felons to prey on innocent people.
p2368
aVIt is the first duty of government to keep the innocent safe, and when I am President I will fight for the safety of every American \u2013 and especially those Americans who have not known safety for a very, very long time.
p2369
aVI am asking for the vote of every African-American citizen struggling in our country today who wants a different future.
p2370
aVIt is time for our society to address some honest and very difficult truths.
p2371
aVThe Democratic Party has failed and betrayed the African-American community.
p2372
aVDemocratic crime policies, education policies, and economic policies have produced only more crime, more broken homes, and more poverty.
p2373
aVLet us look at the situation right here in Milwaukee, a city run by Democrats for decade after decade.
p2374
aVLast year, killings in this city increased by 69 percent, plus another 634 victims of non-fatal shootings.
p2375
aV18-29-year-olds accounted for nearly half of the homicide victims.
p2376
aVThe poverty rate here is nearly double the national average.
p2377
aVAlmost 4 in 10 African-American men in Milwaukee between the ages of 25-54 do not have a job.
p2378
aVNearly Four in 10 single mother households are living in poverty.
p2379
aV55 public schools in this city have been rated as failing to meet expectations, despite ten thousand dollars in funding per-pupil.
p2380
aVThere is only a 60% graduation rate, and it's one of the worst public school systems in the country.
p2381
aV1 in 5 manufacturing jobs has disappeared in Milwaukee since we fully opened our markets to China, and many African-American neighborhoods have borne the brunt of this hit.
p2382
aVTo every voter in Milwaukee, to every voter living in every inner city, or every forgotten stretch of our society, I am running to offer you a better future.
p2383
aVThe Democratic Party has taken the votes of African-Americans for granted.
p2384
aVThey've just assumed they'll get your support and done nothing in return for it.
p2385
aVIt's time to give the Democrats some competition for these votes, and it's time to rebuild the inner cities of America \u2013 and to reject the failed leadership of a rigged political system.
p2386
aVI'm not part of the corrupt system.
p2387
aVIn fact, the corrupt system is trying to stop me.
p2388
aVI've been paying my own way.
p2389
aVThe voters in the Republican Party this year defied the donors, the consultants, the power brokers, and choose a nominee from outside our failed and corrupt and broken system.
p2390
aVThe other party \u2013 the Democratic Party \u2013 nominated the personification of special interest corruption.
p2391
aVThe Democratic Party rigged the nomination to give it to Hillary Clinton, thus giving the soul of their party this year to the special interests.
p2392
aVI am running to listen to your voice, to hear your cries for help.
p2393
aVThe quiet voices in our society, not the loudest demonstrators, need to have their demands heard.
p2394
aVJobs.
p2395
aVSafety.
p2396
aVOpportunity.
p2397
aVFair and equal representation.
p2398
aVWe reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton which panders to and talks down to communities of color and sees them only as votes, not as individual human beings worthy of a better future.
p2399
aVShe doesn't care at all about the hurting people of this country, or the suffering she has caused them.
p2400
aVThe African-American community has been taken for granted for decades by the Democratic Party.
p2401
aVIt's time to break with the failures of the past \u2013 I want to offer Americans a new future.
p2402
aVIt is time for rule by the people, not rule by special interests.
p2403
aVEvery insider, getting rich off of our broken system, is throwing money at Hillary Clinton.
p2404
aVThe hedge fund managers, the Wall Street investors, the professional political class.
p2405
aVIt's the powerful protecting the powerful.
p2406
aVInsiders fighting for insiders.
p2407
aVI am fighting for you!
p2408
aVWhen we talk about the insider, who are we talking about?
p2409
aVIt's the comfortable politicians looking out for their own interests.
p2410
aVIt's the lobbyists who know how to insert that perfect loophole into every bill.
p2411
aVIt's the financial industry knows how to regulate their competition out of existence.
p2412
aVThe insiders also include the media executives, anchors and journalists in Washington, Los Angeles, and New York City, who are part of the same failed status quo and want nothing to change.
p2413
aVEvery day you pick up a newspaper, or turn on the nightly news, and hear about how some banker or some Washington insider says they oppose our campaign.
p2414
aVOr some encrusted old politician says they oppose our campaign.
p2415
aVOr some big time lobbyist says they oppose our campaign.
p2416
aVI wear their opposition as a badge of honor.
p2417
aVBecause it means I am fighting for REAL change, not just partisan change.
p2418
aVI am fighting \u2013 all of us across the country are fighting \u2013 for peaceful regime change in our own country.
p2419
aVThe media-donor-political complex that's bled this country dry has to be replaced with a new government of, by and for the people.
p2420
aVThe leadership class in Washington D.C., of which Hillary Clinton has been a member for thirty years, has abandoned the people of this country.
p2421
aVI am going to give the people their voice back.
p2422
aVThink about it.
p2423
aVThe people opposing our campaign are the same people who have left our border open and let innocent people suffer as a result.
p2424
aVThe people opposing our campaign are the same people who have led us into one disastrous foreign war after another.
p2425
aVThe people opposing our campaign are the same people who lied to us about one trade deal after another.
p2426
aVAren't you tired of a system that gets rich at your expense?
p2427
aVAren't you tired of big media, big businesses, and big donors rigging the system to keep your voice from being heard?
p2428
aVAre you ready for change?
p2429
aVAre you ready for leadership that puts you, the American people, first?
p2430
aVThat puts your country first?
p2431
aVThat puts your family first?
p2432
aVLet's talk about what this means for the inner cities of America.
p2433
aVIt's time to break through the television noise, the entrenched interests.
p2434
aVI understand that a lot of powerful people in our political system \u2013 a lot of people who've created our problems \u2013 will lose a lot of their contracts, and their special gigs, if African-American voters, and all minority voters, support my campaign.
p2435
aVIt's time to stop making the special interests rich.
p2436
aVIt's time to make the American people rich.
p2437
aVI am going to Make America Wealthy Again.
p2438
aVThe Democratic Party has run every inner city in this country for 50 years, and run them into financial ruin.
p2439
aVThey've ruined the schools.
p2440
aVThey've driven out the jobs.
p2441
aVThey've tolerated a level of crime no American should consider acceptable.
p2442
aVViolent crime has risen 17% in America's 50 largest cities last year.
p2443
aVKillings of police officers this year is up nearly 50 percent.
p2444
aVHomicides are up more than 60% in Baltimore.
p2445
aVThey are up more than 50% in Washington, D.C.
p2446
aVThis is future offered by Hillary Clinton.
p2447
aVMore poverty, more crime, and more of the same.
p2448
aVThe future she offers is the most pessimistic thing I can possibly imagine.
p2449
aVIt is time for a different future.
p2450
aVHere is what I am proposing.
p2451
aVFirst, on immigration.
p2452
aVNo community in this country has been hurt worse by Hillary Clinton's immigration policies than the African-American community.
p2453
aVNow she is proposing to print instant work permits for millions of illegal immigrants, taking jobs directly from low-income Americans.
p2454
aVI will secure our border, protect our workers, and improve jobs and wages in your community.
p2455
aVWe will only invite people to join our country who share our tolerant values, who support our Constitution, and who love all of our people.
p2456
aVOn trade, I am going to renegotiate NAFTA, stand up to China, withdraw from the TPP, and protect every last American job.
p2457
aVOn taxes, I am going to give a massive tax cut to every worker and small business in this country, bring thousands of new companies and millions of new jobs onto our shores \u2013 and make it very difficult for our businesses to leave.
p2458
aVI am going to reform our regulations so jobs stay in America, and new businesses come to America to hire workers right here in Milwaukee.
p2459
aVEvery policy my opponent has sends jobs overseas.
p2460
aVI am going to bring trillions in new wealth back to the United States.
p2461
aVOn education, it is time to have school choice, merit pay for teachers, and to end the tenure policies that hurt good teachers and reward bad teachers.
p2462
aVWe are going to put students and parents first.
p2463
aVHillary Clinton would deny opportunities to millions of young African-American children, just so she can curry favor with the education bureaucracy.
p2464
aVI am going to allow charter schools to thrive, and help young kids get on the American ladder of success: a good education, and a good-paying job.
p2465
aVOn crime, I am going to support more police in our communities, appoint the best prosecutors and judges in the country, pursue strong enforcement of federal laws, and I am going to break up the gangs, the cartels and criminal syndicates terrorizing our neighborhoods.
p2466
aVTo every lawbreaker hurting innocent people in this country, I say: your free reign will soon come crashing to an end.
p2467
aVOn healthcare, we are going to get rid of Obamacare \u2013 which has caused soaring double-digit premium increases \u2013 and give choice to patients and consumers.
p2468
aVAetna, just today, announced they are dropping out \u2013 as are many of the major insurance companies.
p2469
aVOn government corruption, I am going to restore honor to our government.
p2470
aVWe've seen the corruption of Hillary Clinton, the mass email deletions, the pay-for-play at the State Department, the profiteering, the favors given to foreign corporations and governments at your expense.
p2471
aVWe've seen a former Secretary of State lie to Congress about her illegal email scheme, risk innocent American lives, and bring dishonor onto our government.
p2472
aVIn my Administration, I am going to enforce all laws concerning the protection of classified information.
p2473
aVNo one will be above the law.
p2474
aVI am going to forbid senior officials from trading favors for cash by preventing them from collecting lavish speaking fees through their spouses when they serve.
p2475
aVI am going to ask my senior officials to sign an agreement not to accept speaking fees from corporations with a registered lobbyist for five years after leaving office, or from any entity tied to a foreign government.
p2476
aVThis is all just the beginning.
p2477
aVWe are going to make this a government of the people once again.
p2478
aVThis is our chance to take back power from all the people who've taken it from you.
p2479
aVThe reason you see the establishment media lining up behind my opponent is because they are scared that you, with your vote, can take away their power and return it to your family and community.
p2480
aVThese are tough times.
p2481
aVBut I know we can make American Greater Than Ever Before.
p2482
aVTo do this, we are going to need a fighter in the White House.
p2483
aVI will be your fighter.
p2484
aVTo defeat crime and Radical Islamic Terrorism in our country, to win trade in our country, you need tremendous physical and mental strength and stamina.
p2485
aVHillary Clinton doesn't have that strength and stamina.
p2486
aVShe cannot win for you.
p2487
aVMost importantly, she has bad judgment.
p2488
aVBad judgment on terrorism, bad judgement on foreign policy, bad judgment on trade.
p2489
aVThe only individuals she's ever delivered for is her donors \u2013 not the people.
p2490
aVI've said it before, and I'll say it again.
p2491
aVMy opponent asks her supporters to repeat three-word pledge.
p2492
aVHer pledge reads: "I'm With Her."
p2493
aVI choose to recite a different pledge.
p2494
aVMy pledge reads: "I'm With You \u2013 the American people."
p2495
aVI will fight to ensure that every American is treated equally, protected equally, and honored equally.
p2496
aVWe will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms, and seek a new future of security, prosperity and opportunity \u2013 a future built on our common culture and values as one American people.
p2497
aVI am asking for your vote so I can be your champion in the White House.
p2498
aVWe will once again be a country of law and order, and a country of great success.
p2499
aVTo every parent who dreams for their children, and to every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I'm with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you.
p2500
aVTogether, We Will Make America Strong Again.
p2501
aVWe Will Make American Safe Again.

aVAnd We Will Make America Great Again.

p2506
aVWe Will Make American Safe Again.
p2507
aVAnd We Will Make America Great Again.
p2508
aVThank you, and God Bless, Donald J. Trump

p2515
aVI am running to listen to your voice, to hear your cries for help.

aVThe quiet voices in our society, not the loudest demonstrators, need to have their demands heard.

aVSafety.
p2519
aVOpportunity.
p2520
aVFair and equal representation.
p2521
aVWe reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton which panders to and talks down to communities of color and sees them only as votes, not as individual human beings worthy of a better future.
p2522
aVShe doesn't care at all about the hurting people of this country, or the suffering she has caused them.
p2523
aVI will fight to ensure that every American is treated equally, protected equally, and honored equally.
p2524
aVWe will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms, and seek a new future of security, prosperity and opportunity \u2013 a future built on our common culture and values as one American people.
p2525
aVTo defeat crime and Radical Islamic Terrorism in our country, to win trade in our country, you need tremendous physical and mental strength and stamina.
p2526
aVHillary Clinton doesn't have that strength and stamina.
p2527
aVShe cannot win for you.
p2528
aVIn my Administration, I am going to enforce all laws concerning the protection of classified information.
p2529
aVNo one will be above the law.
p2530
aVI am going to forbid senior officials from trading favors for cash by preventing them from collecting lavish speaking fees through their spouses when they serve.
p2531
aVI am going to ask my senior officials to sign an agreement not to accept speaking fees from corporations with a registered lobbyist for five years after leaving office, or from any entity tied to a foreign government.
p2532
aVThis is all just the beginning.
p2533
aVWe are going to make this a government of the people once again.
p2534
aVThis is our chance to take back power from all the people who've taken it from you.
p2535
aVThe reason you see the establishment media lining up behind my opponent is because they are scared that you, with your vote, can take away their power and return it to your family and community.
p2536
aVThese are tough times.
p2537
aVBut I know we can make American Greater Than Ever Before!
p2538
aVI am asking for the vote of every African-American citizen struggling in our country today who wants a different future.
p2539
aVIt is time for our society to address some honest and very difficult truths.
p2540
aVThe Democratic Party has failed and betrayed the African-American community.
p2541
aVDemocratic crime policies, education policies, and economic policies have produced only more crime, more broken homes, and more poverty.
p2542
aVFor every one violent protestor, there are a hundred of moms and dads and kids on that same city block who just want to be able to sleep safely at night.
p2543
aVMy opponent would rather protect the offender than the victim.
p2544
aVHillary Clinton-backed policies are responsible for the problems in the inner cities today, and a vote for her is a vote for another generation of poverty, high crime, and lost opportunities.
p2545
aVI care too much about my country to let that happen.
p2546
aVWe all care too much about our country to let that happen!
p2547
aVThere is no compassion in tolerating lawless conduct.
p2548
aVCrime and violence is an attack on the poor, and will never be accepted in a Trump Administration.
p2549
aVThe narrative that has been pushed aggressively for years now by our current Administration, and pushed by my opponent Hillary Clinton, is a false one.
p2550
aVThe problem in our poorest communities is not that there are too many police, the problem is that there are not enough police.
p2551
aVMore law enforcement, more community engagement, more effective policing is what our country needs.
p2552
aVJust like Hillary Clinton is against the miners, she is against the police.
p2553
aVYou know it, and I know it.
p2554
aVThe violence, riots and destruction that have taken place here in Milwaukee is an assault on the right of all citizens to live in security and peace.

p2700
aVThey are nothing more than the failed Washington elite looking to hold onto their power, and it's time they are held accountable for their actions.
p2701
aVThese insiders \u2013 along with Hillary Clinton \u2013 are the owners of the disastrous decisions to invade Iraq, allow Americans to die in Benghazi, and they are the ones who allowed the rise of ISIS.

p2726
aVIt's wonderful to be in Detroit.
p2727
aVWe now begin a great national conversation about economic renewal for America.
p2728
aVIt's a conversation about how to Make American Great Again for everyone, and especially those who have the very least.
p2729
aVThe City of Detroit Is Where Our Story Begins Detroit was once the economic envy of the world.
p2730
aVThe people of Detroit helped power America to its position of global dominance in the 20th century.
p2731
aVWhen we were governed by an America First policy, Detroit was booming.
p2732
aVEngineers, builders, laborers, shippers and countless others went to work each day, provided for their families, and lived out the American Dream.
p2733
aVBut for many living in this city, that dream has long ago vanished.
p2734
aVWhen we abandoned the policy of America First, we started rebuilding other countries instead of our own.
p2735
aVThe skyscrapers went up in Beijing, and in many other cities around the world, while the factories and neighborhoods crumbled in Detroit.
p2736
aVOur roads and bridges fell into disrepair, yet we found the money to resettle millions of refugees at taxpayer expense.
p2737
aVToday, Detroit has a per capita income of under $15,000 dollars, about half of the national average.
p2738
aV40 percent of the city's residents live in poverty, over two-and-half times the national average.
p2739
aVThe unemployment rate is more than twice the national average.
p2740
aVHalf of all Detroit residents do not work.
p2741
aVDetroit tops the list of Most Dangerous Cities in terms of violent crime \u2013 these are the silenced victims whose stories are never told by Hillary Clinton, but victims whose suffering is no less real or permanent.
p2742
aVIn short, the city of Detroit is the living, breathing example of my opponent's failed economic agenda.
p2743
aVEvery policy that has failed this city, and so many others, is a policy supported by Hillary Clinton.
p2744
aVShe supports the high taxes and radical regulation that forced jobs out of your community\u2026and the crime policies that have made you less safe\u2026and the immigration policies that have strained local budgets...and the trade deals like NAFTA, signed by her husband, that have shipped your jobs to Mexico and other countries\u2026 and she supports the education policies that deny your students choice, freedom and opportunity.
p2745
aVShe is the candidate of the past.
p2746
aVOurs is the campaign of the future.
p2747
aVThis is a city controlled by Democratic politicians at every level, and unless we change policies, we will not change results.
p2748
aVToday, I will outline my economic vision.
p2749
aVIn the coming weeks, we will be offering more detail on all of these policies, and the ones we have already rolled out can be viewed on my campaign website.
p2750
aVOur opposition, on the other hand, has long ago run out of ideas.
p2751
aVAll Hillary Clinton has to offer is more of the same: more taxes, more regulations, more bureaucrats, more restrictions on American energy and American production.
p2752
aVIf you were a foreign power looking to weaken America, you couldn't do better than Hillary Clinton's economic agenda.
p2753
aVNothing would make our foreign adversaries happier than for our country to tax and regulate our companies and our jobs out of existence.
p2754
aVThe one common feature of every Hillary Clinton idea is that it punishes you for working and doing business in the United States.
p2755
aVEvery policy she has tilts the playing field towards other countries at our expense.
p2756
aVThat's why she tries to distract us with tired political rhetoric that seeks to label us, divide us, and pull us apart.
p2757
aVMy campaign is about reaching out to everyone as Americans, and returning to a government that puts the American people first.
p2758
aVHere is what an America First economic plan looks like.
p2759
aVFirst, let's talk tax reform.
p2760
aVTaxes are one of the biggest differences in this race.
p2761
aVHillary Clinton \u2013 who has spent her career voting for tax increases \u2013 plans another massive job-killing $1.3 trillion-dollar tax increase.
p2762
aVHer plan would tax many small businesses by almost fifty percent.
p2763
aVRecently, at a campaign event, Hillary Clinton short-circuited again \u2013 to use a now famous term \u2013 when she accidentally told the truth and said she wanted to raise taxes on the middle class.
p2764
aVI am proposing an across-the-board income tax reduction, especially for middle-income Americans.
p2765
aVThis will lead to millions of new good-paying jobs.
p2766
aVThe rich will pay their fair share, but no one will pay so much that it destroys jobs, or undermines our ability to compete.
p2767
aVAs part of this reform, we will eliminate the Carried Interest Deduction and other special interest loopholes that have been so good for Wall Street investors, and people like me, but unfair to American workers.
p2768
aVTax simplification will be a major feature of the plan.
p2769
aVOur current tax code is so burdensome and complex that we waste 9 billion hours a year in tax code compliance.
p2770
aVMy plan will reduce the current number of brackets from 7 to 3, and dramatically streamline the process.
p2771
aVWe will work with House Republicans on this plan, using the same brackets they have proposed: 12, 25 and 33 percent.
p2772
aVFor many American workers, their tax rate will be zero.
p2773
aVWhile we will develop our own set of assumptions and policies, agreeing in some areas but not in others, we will be focused on the same shared goals and guided by the same shared principles: jobs, growth and opportunity.
p2774
aVThese reforms will offer the biggest tax revolution since the Reagan Tax Reform, which unleashed years of continued economic growth and job creation.
p2775
aVWe will Make America Grow Again.
p2776
aVIn the days ahead, we will provide more details on this plan and how it will help you and your family.
p2777
aVIt will present a night-and-day contrast to the job-killing, tax-raising, poverty-inducing Obama-Clinton agenda.
p2778
aVThe State of New York has already lived through Hillary Clinton's failed leadership.
p2779
aVThe Washington Post just published a devastating article on Hillary Clinton's broken promises.
p2780
aVShe pledged 200,000 jobs for upstate New York as Senator.
p2781
aVBut what happened?
p2782
aVThe Washington Post writes, and I quote: "upstate job growth stagnated overall during her tenure, with manufacturing jobs plunging nearly 25 percent\u2026the former first lady was unable to pass big ticket legislation\u2026 Many promised jobs never materialized and others migrated to other states as she turned to her first presidential run\u2026data shows that upstate actually lost jobs during Clinton's first term."
p2783
aVCompare that to my record.
p2784
aVIn a recent New York Post article by Steve Cuozzo, "How Donald Trump Helped Save New York City," the paper writes that I \u2013 and this is a direct quote \u2013 "waded into a landscape of empty Fifth Avenue storefronts, the dust-bowl mugging ground that was Central Park and a Wall Street area seemingly on its last legs as companies moved out\u2026almost by force of will \u2014 [he] rode to the rescue.
p2785
aVExpressing rare faith in the future, he was instrumental in kick-starting the regeneration of neighborhoods and landmarks almost given up for dead."
p2786
aVThis is what I want to do for our country \u2013 I want to jumpstart America.
p2787
aVNow let's look at what the Obama-Clinton policies have done nationally.
p2788
aVTheir policies produced 1.2% growth, the weakest so-called recovery since the Great Depression, and a doubling of the national debt.
p2789
aVThere are now 94.3 million Americans outside the labor force.
p2790
aVIt was 80.5 million when President Obama took office, an increase of nearly 14 million people.
p2791
aVThe Obama-Clinton agenda of tax, spend and regulate has created a silent nation of jobless Americans.
p2792
aVHome ownership is at its lowest rate in 51 years.
p2793
aVNearly 12 million have been added to the food stamp rolls since President Obama took office.
p2794
aVAnother nearly 7 million Americans are living in poverty.
p2795
aVWe have the lowest labor force participation rates in four decades.
p2796
aV58 percent of African-American youth are either outside the labor force or not employed.
p2797
aV1 in 5 American households do not have a single member in the labor force.
p2798
aVThese are the real unemployment numbers \u2013 the five percent figure is one of the biggest hoaxes in modern politics.
p2799
aVMeanwhile, American households are earning more than $4,000 less today than they were sixteen years ago.
p2800
aVThe average worker today pays 31.5 percent of their wages to income and payroll taxes.
p2801
aVOn top of that, state and local taxes consume another 10 percent.
p2802
aVThe United States also has the highest business tax rate among the major industrialized nations of the world, at 35 percent.
p2803
aVIt's almost 40 percent when you add in taxes at the state level.
p2804
aVIn other words, we punish companies for making products in America \u2013 but let them ship products into the U.S. tax-free if they move overseas.
p2805
aVThis is backwards.
p2806
aVAll of our policies should be geared towards keeping jobs and wealth inside the United States.
p2807
aVUnder my plan, no American company will pay more than 15% of their business income in taxes.
p2808
aVSmall businesses will benefit the most from this plan.
p2809
aVHillary Clinton's plan will require small business to pay as much as three times more in taxes than what I am proposing, and her onerous regulations will put them totally out of business.
p2810
aVI am going to cut regulations massively.
p2811
aVOur lower business tax will also end job-killing corporate inversions, and cause trillions in new dollars and wealth to come pouring into our country \u2013 and into cities like Detroit.
p2812
aVTo help unleash this new job creation, we will allow businesses to immediately expense new business investments.
p2813
aVNo one will gain more from these proposals than low-and-middle income Americans.
p2814
aVMy plan will also help reduce the cost of childcare by allowing parents to fully deduct the average cost of childcare spending from their taxes.
p2815
aVWe are also going to bring back trillions of dollars from American businesses that is now parked overseas.
p2816
aVOur plan will bring that cash home, applying a 10 percent tax.
p2817
aVThis money will be re-invested in states like Michigan.
p2818
aVFinally, no family will have to pay the death tax.
p2819
aVAmerican workers have paid taxes their whole lives, and they should not be taxed again at death \u2013 it's just plain wrong.
p2820
aVWe will repeal it.
p2821
aVNext comes regulatory reform  As with taxes, I will have one overriding goal when it comes to regulation: I want to keep jobs and wealth in America  Motor vehicle manufacturing is one of the most heavily regulated industries in the country.
p2822
aVThe U.S. economy today is twenty-five percent smaller than it would have been without the surge of regulations since 1980.
p2823
aVIt is estimated that current overregulation is costing our economy as much as $2 trillion dollars a year \u2013 that's money taken straight out of cities like yours.
p2824
aVThe federal register is now over 80,000 pages long.
p2825
aVAs the Wall Street Journal noted, President Obama has issued close to four hundred new major regulations since taking office, each with a cost to the American economy of $100 million or more.
p2826
aVIn 2015 alone, the Obama Administration unilaterally issued more than 2,000 new regulations \u2013 each a hidden tax on American consumers, and a massive lead weight on the American economy.
p2827
aVIt is time to remove the anchor dragging us down.
p2828
aVUpon taking office, I will issue a temporary moratorium on new agency regulations.
p2829
aVMy running mate, Mike Pence, signed a similar order when he became governor of Indiana.
p2830
aVThis will give our American companies the certainty they need to reinvest in our community, get cash off of the sidelines, start hiring for new jobs, and expanding businesses.
p2831
aVI will also immediately cancel all illegal and overreaching executive orders.
p2832
aVNext, I will ask each and every federal agency to prepare a list of all of the regulations they impose on Americans which are not necessary, do not improve public safety, and which needlessly kill jobs.
p2833
aVThose regulations will be eliminated.
p2834
aVWe are in a competition with the world, and I want America to win.
p2835
aVWhen I am president, we will.
p2836
aVOne of the most important reforms of all is trade reform.
p2837
aVAs Bernie Sanders has said, Hillary Clinton has bad judgment.
p2838
aVWe've seen this bad judgment overseas, in Libya, Iraq, and Syria.
p2839
aVWe've seen it in Iran.
p2840
aVWe've seen it from President Obama, when he gives $150 billion to Iran, the number one terror state, and even gives them $400 million in money-laundered cash as a ransom payment.
p2841
aVBut we've also seen the terrible Obama-Clinton judgment right here in Detroit Hillary Clinton has supported the trade deals stripping this city, and this country, of its jobs and wealth.
p2842
aVShe supported Bill Clinton's NAFTA, she supported China's entrance into the World Trade Organization, she supported the job-killing trade deal with South Korea, and she supports the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
p2843
aVLet's talk about South Korea for a moment, because it so perfectly illustrates the broken promises that have hurt so many American workers.
p2844
aVPresident Obama, and the usual so-called experts who've been wrong about every trade deal for decades, predicted that the trade deal with South Korea would increase our exports to South Korea by more than $10 billion \u2013 resulting in some 70,000 jobs.
p2845
aVLike Hillary Clinton's broken promises to New York, these pledges all turned out to be false.
p2846
aVInstead of creating 70,000 jobs, it has killed nearly 100,000, according to the Economic Policy Institute.
p2847
aVOur exports to South Korea haven't increased at all, but their imports to us have surged more than $15 billion \u2013 more than doubling our trade deficit with that country.
p2848
aVThe next betrayal will be the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
p2849
aVHillary Clinton's closest friend, Terry McAuliffe, confirmed what I have said on this from the beginning: if sent to the Oval Office, Hillary Clinton will enact the TPP.
p2850
aVGuaranteed.
p2851
aVHer donors will make sure of it.
p2852
aVA vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for TPP \u2013 and it's also a vote for NAFTA.
p2853
aVOur annual trade deficit in goods with Mexico has risen from close to zero in 1993 to almost $60 billion.
p2854
aVOur total trade deficit in goods hit nearly $800 billion last year.
p2855
aVThis is a strike at the heart of Michigan, and our nation as a whole.
p2856
aVAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, before NAFTA went into effect, there were 285,000 auto workers in Michigan.
p2857
aVToday, that number is only 160,000 Detroit is still waiting for Hillary Clinton's apology.
p2858
aVI expect Detroit will get that apology right around the same time Hillary Clinton turns over the 33,000 emails she deleted.
p2859
aVHillary Clinton's Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) will be an even bigger disaster for the auto industry.
p2860
aVIn fact, Ford Motor Company has announced its opposition to the deal.
p2861
aVAccording to the Economic Policy Institute, the U.S. trade deficit with the proposed TPP member countries cost over 1 million manufacturing jobs in 2015.
p2862
aVBy far the biggest losses occurred in motor vehicles and parts, which lost nearly 740,000 manufacturing jobs.
p2863
aVMichigan ranks first for jobs lost as a share of state workforce due to the trade deficit with TPP members.
p2864
aVJust imagine how many more automobile jobs will be lost if the TPP is actually approved.
p2865
aVThat is why I have announced we will withdraw from the deal before that can ever happen.
p2866
aVHillary Clinton will never withdraw from the TPP.
p2867
aVShe is bought, controlled and paid-for by her donors and special interests.
p2868
aVBecause my only interest is the American people, I have previously laid out a detailed 7-point plan for trade reform, available on my website.
p2869
aVIt includes strong protections against currency manipulation, tariffs against any countries that cheat by unfairly subsidizing their goods, and it includes a renegotiation of NAFTA.
p2870
aVIf we don't get a better deal, we will walk away.
p2871
aVAt the center of my plan is trade enforcement with China.
p2872
aVThis alone could return millions of jobs into our economy.
p2873
aVChina is responsible for nearly half of our entire trade deficit.
p2874
aVThey break the rules in every way imaginable.
p2875
aVChina engages in illegal export subsidies, prohibited currency manipulation, and rampant theft of intellectual property.
p2876
aVThey also have no real environmental or labor protections, further undercutting American workers.
p2877
aVJust enforcing intellectual property rules alone could save millions of American jobs.
p2878
aVAccording to the U.S. International Trade Commission, improved protection of America's intellectual property in China would produce more than 2 million more jobs right here in the United States.
p2879
aVAdd to that the saved jobs from cracking down on currency cheating and product dumping, and we will bring trillions of dollars in new wealth and wages back to the United States.
p2880
aVTrade has big benefits, and I am in favor of trade.
p2881
aVBut I want great trade deals for our country that create more jobs and higher wages for American workers.
p2882
aVIsolation is not an option, only great and well-crafted trade deals are.
p2883
aVAlso critical to our economic renewal will be energy reform.
p2884
aVThe Obama-Clinton Administration has blocked and destroyed millions of jobs through their anti-energy regulations, while raising the price of electricity for both families and businesses.
p2885
aVAs a result of recent Obama EPA actions coal-fired power plants across Michigan have either shut down entirely or undergone expensive conversions.
p2886
aVThe Obama-Clinton war on coal has cost Michigan over 50,000 jobs.
p2887
aVHillary Clinton says her plan will "put a lot of coal companies and coal miners out of business."
p2888
aVWe will put our coal miners and steel workers back to work.
p2889
aVClinton not only embraces President Obama's job-killing energy restrictions but wants to expand them, including going after oil and natural gas production that employs some 10 million Americans.
p2890
aVAccording to the Heritage Foundation, by 2030, the Obama-Clinton energy restrictions will eliminate another half a million manufacturing jobs, reduce economic output by $2.5 trillion dollars, and reduce incomes by $7,000 dollars per person.
p2891
aVA Trump Administration will end this war on the American worker, and unleash an energy revolution that will bring vast new wealth to our country.
p2892
aVAccording to the Institute for Energy Research, lifting the restrictions on all sources of American energy will:   \u2022 Increase GDP by more than $100 billion dollars annually, add over 500,000 new jobs annually, and increase annual wages by more than $30 billion dollars over the next 7 years;   \u2022 Increase federal, state, and local tax revenues by almost $6 trillion dollars over 4 decades;   \u2022 Increase total economic activity by more than $20 trillion dollars over the next 40 years.
p2893
aVThe reforms I have outlined today are only the beginning   When we reform our tax, trade, energy and regulatory policies, we will open a new chapter in American Prosperity.
p2894
aVWe can use this new wealth to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.
p2895
aVAs part of this new future, we will also be rolling out proposals to increase choice and reduce cost in childcare, offering much-needed relief to American families.
p2896
aVI will unveil my plan on this in the coming weeks that I have been working on with my daughter Ivanka and an incredible team of experts.
p2897
aVLikewise, our education reforms will help parents send their kids to a school of their choice.
p2898
aVWe will also give our police and law enforcement the funds and support they need to restore law and order to this country.
p2899
aVWithout security, there can be no prosperity.
p2900
aVWe must have law and order.
p2901
aVIn the coming days, we will be rolling out plans on all of these items.
p2902
aVOne of my first acts as President will be to repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare, saving another 2 million American jobs.
p2903
aVWe will also rebuild our military, and get our allies to pay their fair share for the protection we provide \u2013 saving us countless more billions to invest in our own country.
p2904
aVWe also have a plan, on our website, for a complete reform of the Veterans Health Administration.
p2905
aVThis is something so desperately needed to make sure our vets are fully supported and get the care they deserve.
p2906
aVDetroit \u2013 the Motor City \u2013 will come roaring back.
p2907
aVWe will offer a new future, not the same old failed policies of the past.
p2908
aVOur party has chosen to make new history by selecting a nominee from outside the rigged and corrupt system.
p2909
aVThe other party has reached backwards into the past to choose a nominee from yesterday \u2013 who offers only the rhetoric of yesterday, and the policies of yesterday.
p2910
aVThere will be no change under Hillary Clinton \u2013 only four more years of Obama.
p2911
aVBut we are going to look boldly into the future.
p2912
aVWe will build the next generation of roads, bridges, railways, tunnels, sea ports and airports that our country deserves.
p2913
aVAmerican cars will travel the roads, American planes will connect our cities, and American ships will patrol the seas.
p2914
aVAmerican steel will send new skyscrapers soaring.
p2915
aVWe will put new American metal into the spine of this nation.
p2916
aVIt will be American hands that rebuild this country, and it will be American energy - mined from American sources - that powers this country.
p2917
aVIt will be American workers who are hired to do the job.
p2918
aVAmericanism, not globalism, will be our new credo.
p2919
aVOur country will reach amazing new heights.
p2920
aVAll we have to do is stop relying on the tired voices of the past.
p2921
aVWe can't fix a rigged system by relying on the people who rigged it in the first place.
p2922
aVWe can't solve our problems by relying on the politicians who created them.
p2923
aVOnly by changing to new leadership, and new solutions, will we get new results.
p2924
aVWe need to stop believing in politicians, and start believing in America.
p2925
aVBefore everything great that has ever happened, the doubters have always said it couldn't be done.
p2926
aVAmerica is ready to prove the doubters wrong.
p2927
aVThey want you to think small.
p2928
aVI am asking you to think big.
p2929
aVWe are ready to dream great things for our country once again.
p2930
aVWe are ready to show the world that America is Back \u2013 Bigger, and Better and Stronger Than Ever Before.

p2983
aVClinton's home email server that she lied to the American people about was a profound national security risk, and it should come as no surprise that her campaign would push out another Obama-Clinton pawn (who is not independent) to try to change the subject in a week when Clinton's role in putting Iran on the path to nuclear weapons and this Administration being called out for sending $400 million in cash to the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism is on every front page in the country.

aVDONALD J. TRUMP CAMPAIGN ANNOUNCES SUCCESSFUL GROWTH WITH $80 MILLION FUNDRAISING HAUL  (New York, NY) Aug 3rd, 2016 \u2013 Today the Donald J. Trump Campaign for President announced impressive totals from July's fundraising efforts.
p3008
aVThe campaign's digital and direct mail operations (in conjunction with the RNC) resulted in approximately $64 million dollars in donations for July.
p3009
aVLast month we continued our $2 million matching program from Mr. Trump bringing his overall contributions to the campaign in excess of $56 million.
p3010
aVHis contributions for the month far surpass the FEC required reimbursements to his related entities, i.e., airplane, Trump properties and the like.
p3011
aVThe Campaign and both Joint Fundraising Committees also have very strong cash on hand numbers totaling approximately $74 million ($37 million for DJTFP, $37 million for TMAGA/TV).
p3012
aVThe results from this month show the enthusiastic movement the campaign has created since we started our online fundraising efforts in June.
p3013
aVThe campaign very much appreciates the broad based support, and will work hard to achieve victory in November and Make America Great Again.
p3014
aVThe campaign, in conjunction with the RNC, also hosted 20 fundraising events throughout the country for Trump Victory raising over $16 million.
p3015
aVThe Campaign continues to work with the RNC to support its important operations for the Republican Party, and elect Republicans down the ballot this November.
p3016
aVThe campaign expects this success to continue throughout the coming months with the support of small dollar contributions from passionate supporters across the country.
p3017
aV"We are extremely proud of our 69% growth in small dollar donations which shows the broad based support of over one million donors across America.
p3018
aVOur volunteers and contributors are clearly committed to electing Donald J. Trump as President in November."
p3019

aVSTATEMENT FROM CHARLES WOODS, FATHER OF BENGHAZI HERO TYRONE WOODS  (New York, NY) August 2nd, 2016 - Today Donald J. Trump received the endorsement of Charles Woods the father of Tyrone Woods, a former Navy SEAL, who gave his life fighting to protect Americans during the terror attacks on the U.S. consulate and the CIA compound in Benghazi.
p3038
aVTy's sacrifice saved more than twenty-five American lives, and he is truly an American hero.
p3039
aVMr. Woods chose to endorse Mr. Trump stating, "I support Donald Trump, and the main reason is national security as well as the economy are the two most important issues that voters are going to have to decide upon next November."
p3040
aVHillary Clinton's poor judgment led to these tragic deaths in Libya.
p3041
aVFirst, her reckless decision to invade Libya unleashed radical Islamic terror groups that threatened Americans.
p3042
aVCompounded with her failure to provide the necessary security upgrades and reinforcements cost four Americans their lives.
p3043
aVAfter it all, she lied to the world about what happened to cover up the role of Radical Islam.
p3044
aVWe could have known more about her actions, but she illegally stored and then deleted 33,000 emails.
p3045
aVMr. Trump stated, "Tyrone Woods is an American hero and his father is a tremendous person whom I have great respect for.
p3046
aVHis support is so important to me.
p3047
aVTogether we are going to defeat Hillary Clinton in November and make America safe again."

aVTRUMP CAMPAIGN STATEMENT ON CLINTON'S ACCEPTANCE SPEECH  Hillary Clinton's speech was an insulting collection of clichs and recycled rhetoric.
p3158
aVShe spent the evening talking down to the American people she's looked down on her whole life.
p3159
aVHillary Clinton talks about unity, about E Pluribus Unum, but her globalist agenda denies American citizens the protections to which they are all entitled \u2013 tearing us apart.
p3160
aVHer radical amnesty plan will take jobs, resources and benefits from the most vulnerable citizens of the United States and give them to the citizens of other countries.
p3161
aVHer refusal to even say the words 'Radical Islam', or to mention her disaster in Libya, or her corrupt email scheme, all show how little she cares about the safety of the American people.
p3162
aVIt's a speech delivered from a fantasy universe, not the reality we live in today.
p3163
aVHillary Clinton says America is stronger together.
p3164
aVBut in Hillary Clinton's America, millions of people are left out in the cold.
p3165
aVShe only stands together with the donors and special interests who've bankrolled her entire life.
p3166
aVExcluded from Hillary Clinton's America are the suffering people living in our inner cities, or the victims of open borders and drug cartels, or the people who've lost their jobs because of the Clintons' trade deals, or any hardworking person who doesn't have enough money to get a seat at Hillary Clinton's table.
p3167
aVHillary's vision is a borderless world where working people have no power, no jobs, no safety.
p3168
aVOur way of life is under threat by Radical Islam and Hillary Clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words!
p3169
aVHillary's refusal to mention Radical Islam, as she pushes a 550% increase in refugees, is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country.

aVAt Hillary Clinton's convention this week, Democrats have been speaking about a world that doesn't exist.
p3180
aVA world where America has full employment, where there's no such thing as radical Islamic terrorism, where the border is totally secured, and where thousands of innocent Americans have not suffered from rising crime in cities like Baltimore and Chicago.
p3181
aVIn the Democrats' fantasy world, there is no problem with Hillary Clinton maintaining an illegal, exposed server full of classified information that could have been hacked by any foreign enemy, and in which Hillary Clinton risked prison time to delete 33,000 emails that were simply about yoga and wedding planning.
p3182
aVIn this world, there is no Hillary Clinton disaster in Syria, Libya and Egypt, ISIS doesn't merit a mention, Iran isn't on the path to nukes, convention stages don't need American flags, and our great men and women of law enforcement, our police, do not need to be honored.
p3183
aVI propose a different vision for America, one where we can break up Washington's rigged system, and empower all Americans to achieve their dreams.
p3184

aVFEDERAL COURT SIDES WITH GRASSROOTS ACTIVISTS: RNC DELEGATES ARE BOUND TO FOLLOW ELECTION RESULTS  Delegates Remain Committed to Donald J. Trump;  Anti-Trump Effort Dealt Crippling Blow  (New York) July 11, 2016 \u2013 Senior United States District Judge Robert E. Payne today ruled in favor of Trump campaign delegates who had argued \u2013 in line with overwhelming public opinion \u2013 that RNC delegates must follow election results and that delegates cannot be stolen at the national convention.
p3554
aVDelegate Beau Correll, Jr., had brought the suit against the Commonwealth of Virginia hoping to reject the will of the voters, but was soundly defeated.
p3555
aVSpecifically, the Court found that RNC Rule 16, which binds delegates based on their election results, "is in effect presently and that it controls the allocation and binding of delegates as to their voting at convention."
p3556
aV(p. 6) The Court held that the Plaintiff's "expert testimony" from Erling 'Curly' Haugland was not credible, lacked "textual support," (p.6) and that "delegates are bound by RNC Rule 16."
p3557
aV(p. 7)  Further, the Court found that by signing the "Declaration and Statement of Qualification," RNC delegates are bound by RNC Rule 16(c)(2) (p. 10), and that this Declaration obligated Correll to vote in accordance with Republican Party rules and Virginia's election results.
p3558
aV(p. 46)  Trump Campaign Attorney and former FEC Chairman Don McGahn issued the following statement:  "The court has confirmed what we have said all along: Rule 16 is in effect and thus delegates, including Correll, are bound to vote in accordance with the election results.
p3559
aVThe court did not buy what Curly Haugland was selling, and noted that his testimony has no support in the rule's text and was contradicted by his own book, Unbound.
p3560
aVThis case puts his unbound theory to rest, and is a fatal blow to the Anti-Trump agitators."

aVDONALD J. TRUMP STATEMENT ON FALSE ACCUSATION FROM HILLARY CLINTON:   These false attacks by Hillary Clinton trying to link the Star of David with a basic star, often used by sheriffs who deal with criminals and criminal behavior, showing an inscription that says "Crooked Hillary is the most corrupt candidate ever" with anti-Semitism is ridiculous.
p3675
aVClinton, through her surrogates, is just trying to divert attention from the dishonest behavior of herself and her husband.
p3676
aVThe real questions are, why was Bill Clinton meeting secretly with the US Attorney General on her case and where are the 33,000 missing emails and all of the other information missing from her case -  Why are there so many lies?
p3677
aVSTATEMENT FROM TRUMP CAMPAIGN SOCIAL MEDIA DIRECTOR DAN SCAVINO:  The social media graphic used this weekend was not created by the campaign nor was it sourced from an anti-Semitic site.
p3678
aVIt was lifted from an anti-Hillary Twitter user where countless images appear.
p3679
aVThe sheriff's badge \u2013 which is available under Microsoft's "shapes" - fit with the theme of corrupt Hillary and that is why I selected it.

aVYet another terrorist attack today in Israel -- a father, shot at by a Palestinian terrorist, was killed while driving his car, and three of his children who were passengers were severely injured.

p3730
aVWRONG: https://www.lyingcrookedhillary.com/lie/secret-server-hillary-broke-the-rules-lied-about-it  A report by the State Department's own watchdog destroys Clinton's lie that she followed the rules.
p3731
aVShe did not get permission from anyone to exclusively use private email for all of her government work; she failed the requirement to use an authorized and secure system for her email communications; she broke federal records laws by shielding her official records from congressional and public scrutiny; and, she ignored warning after warning that her setup posed a significant cybersecurity risk.
p3732
aVThere is no question that what she did was not allowed.
p3733
aVThe only question that remains is up to the FBI: was it criminal?

p3753

aVForgotten History: How American Presidents from Washington to Lincoln Agree with Trump on Trade:
p3774
aVICYMI: TRUMP ISSUES TPP CHALLENGE TO CLINTON - WILL SHE ANSWER?
p3775
aVIn his speech yesterday, "Declaring American Economic Independence," Donald J. Trump made the case for Americanism over Hillary Clinton's Globalism, and detailed how the Trans-Pacific Partnership would undermine U.S. sovereignty and economic prosperity.
p3776
aVHe announced he would withdraw from the TPP and negotiate bilateral trade deals that protect U.S. economic interests.
p3777
aVHe then challenged Hillary Clinton, longtime enthusiastic booster of the TPP, if she too would pledge to withdraw from the pact and rule out its passage in any form.
p3778
aVClinton now weakly says she only has issues with the TPP "currently...in its current form," politician-speak for saying she will approve it at the very earliest opportunity.
p3779
aVThis would follow her same pattern of behavior on the Columbia and South Korea trade deals.Good luck though finding her for an answer: it's been 208 days since she last held a press conferences  Relevant excerpt follows below.
p3780
aVRead the full footnoted speech here: "Declaring American Economic Independence"   TRUMP: "The TPP creates a new international commission that makes decisions the American people are no longer given the right to veto.
p3781
aVThese commissions are great for Hillary's Wall Street funders, who can spend vast amounts of money to influence the people on the commissions and the outcomes.
p3782
aVIt should be no surprise, then, that Hillary Clinton, according to Bloomberg, took a leading part in drafting the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
p3783
aVPlease remember that, especially in November.
p3784
aVShe praised or pushed the TPP on 45 separate occasions, and even called it the gold standard.
p3785
aVHillary Clinton was totally for the TPP just a short while ago.
p3786
aVBut when she saw my stance \u2014 which is totally against \u2014 she was shamed into saying she would be against it, too.
p3787
aVAnd I will tell you, it was the same shame that she had recently where she was sort of forced into saying radical "Islamic terrorism," which she didn't want to say, but she was shamed into that.
p3788
aVBut have no doubt that she will immediately approve it, if it is put before her.
p3789
aVAnd that is guaranteed.
p3790
aVGuaranteed.
p3791
aVShe will do this, just as she has betrayed American workers for Wall Street and throughout \u2014 throughout her career.
p3792
aVHer whole career she has betrayed the American worker.
p3793
aVShe is trying to put on a good front now, she will betray you again.
p3794
aVHer career and her husband have signed so many disasters and never, ever forget NAFTA.
p3795
aVJust never ever forget it, because you know what it's done and I know what it's done.
p3796
aVAnd in touring, I've seen the devastation that it's left behind.
p3797
aVHere's how it would go.
p3798
aVShe would make a small token change, declare the TPP Pact fixed and ram it through and you will suffer.
p3799
aVThat is why Hillary is now only saying she has problems with TPP in its current form.
p3800
aVYou know what that means.
p3801
aVThat means like they will make a little two-word change and she will fix it and she will feel great.
p3802
aVBut she says in its current form, she can rush to embrace it again and she will at the earliest opportunity.
p3803
aVIf the media doesn't believe me, I have a challenge for you and Hillary.
p3804
aVAsk Hillary if she is willing to withdraw from the TPP her first day in office and unconditionally rule out its passage in any form."

aVDONALD J. TRUMP ON THE STAKES OF THE ELECTION  Today I'd like to share my thoughts about the stakes in this election.
p3952
aVPeople have asked me why I am running for President.
p3953
aVI have built an amazing business that I love and I get to work side-by-side with my children every day.
p3954
aVWe come to work together and turn visions into reality.
p3955
aVWe think big, and then we make it happen.
p3956
aVI love what I do, and I am grateful beyond words to the nation that has allowed me to do it.
p3957
aVSo when people ask me why I am running, I quickly answer: I am running to give back to this country which has been so good to me.
p3958
aVWhen I see the crumbling roads and bridges, or the dilapidated airports, or the factories moving overseas to Mexico, or to other countries, I know these problems can all be fixed, but not by Hillary Clinton \u2013 only by me.
p3959
aVThe fact is, we can come back bigger and better and stronger than ever before --Jobs, jobs, jobs!
p3960
aVEverywhere I look, I see the possibilities of what our country could be.
p3961
aVBut we can't solve any of these problems by relying on the politicians who created them.
p3962
aVWe will never be able to fix a rigged system by counting on the same people who rigged it in the first place.
p3963
aVThe insiders wrote the rules of the game to keep themselves in power and in the money.
p3964
aVThat's why we're asking Bernie Sanders' voters to join our movement: so together we can fix the system for ALL Americans.
p3965
aVImportantly, this includes fixing all of our many disastrous trade deals.
p3966
aVBecause it's not just the political system that's rigged.
p3967
aVIt's the whole economy.
p3968
aVIt's rigged by big donors who want to keep down wages.
p3969
aVIt's rigged by big businesses who want to leave our country, fire our workers, and sell their products back into the U.S. with absolutely no consequences for them.
p3970
aVIt's rigged by bureaucrats who are trapping kids in failing schools.
p3971
aVIt's rigged against you, the American people.
p3972
aVHillary Clinton who, as most people know, is a world class liar \u2013  just look at her pathetic email and server statements, or her phony landing in Bosnia where she said she was under attack but the attack turned out to be young girls handing her flowers, a total self-serving lie.
p3973
aV[1]  Brian Williams' career was destroyed for saying far less.
p3974
aVYesterday, she even tried to attack me and my many businesses.
p3975
aVBut here is the bottom line: I started off in Brooklyn New York, not so long ago, with a small loan and built a business worth over 10 billion dollars.
p3976
aVI have always had a talent for building businesses and, importantly, creating jobs.
p3977
aVThat is a talent our country desperately needs.
p3978
aVI am running for President to end the unfairness and to put you, the American worker, first.
p3979
aVWe are going to put America First, and we are going to Make America Great again.
p3980
aVThis election will decide whether we are ruled by the people, or by the politicians.
p3981
aVHere is my promise to the American voter:  If I am elected President, I will end the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C.
p3982
aVThe other candidate in this race has spent her entire life making money for special interests \u2013 and taking money from special interests.
p3983
aVHillary Clinton has perfected the politics of personal profit and theft.
p3984
aVShe ran the State Department like her own personal hedge fund \u2013 doing favors for oppressive regimes, and many others, in exchange for cash.
p3985
aVThen, when she left, she made $21.6 million giving speeches to Wall Street banks and other special interests \u2013 in less than 2 years \u2013 secret speeches that she does not want to reveal to the public.
p3986
aV[2] [3]  Together, she and Bill made $153 million giving speeches to lobbyists, CEOs, and foreign governments in the years since 2001.
p3987
aV[4]  They totally own her, and that will never change.
p3988
aVThe choice in this election is a choice between taking our government back from the special interests, or surrendering our last scrap of independence to their total and complete control.
p3989
aVThose are the stakes.
p3990
aVHillary Clinton wants to be President.
p3991
aVBut she doesn't have the temperament, or, as Bernie Sanders' said, the judgement, to be president.
p3992
aVShe believes she is entitled to the office.
p3993
aVHer campaign slogan is "I'm with her."
p3994
aVYou know what my response to that is?
p3995
aVI'm with you: the American people.
p3996
aVShe thinks it's all about her.
p3997
aVI know it's all about you \u2013 I know it's all about making America Great Again for All Americans.
p3998
aVOur country lost its way when we stopped putting the American people first.
p3999
aVWe got here because we switched from a policy of Americanism \u2013 focusing on what's good for America's middle class \u2013 to a policy of globalism, focusing on how to make money for large corporations who can move their wealth and workers to foreign countries all to the detriment of the American worker and the American economy.
p4000
aVWe reward companies for offshoring, and we punish companies for doing business in America and keeping our workers employed.
p4001
aVThis is not a rising tide that lifts all boats.
p4002
aVThis is a wave of globalization that wipes out our middle class and our jobs.
p4003
aVWe need to reform our economic system so that, once again, we can all succeed together, and America can become rich again.
p4004
aVThat's what we mean by America First.
p4005
aVOur country will be better off when we start making our own products again, bringing our once great manufacturing capabilities back to our shores.
p4006
aVOur Founders understood this.
p4007
aVOne of the first major bills signed by George Washington called for "the encouragement and protection of manufactur[ing]" in America.
p4008
aV[5]  Our first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, warned us by saying:  "The abandonment of the protective policy by the American government will produce want and ruin among our people.
p4009
aV"[6]  I have visited the cities and towns across America and seen the devastation caused by the trade policies of Bill and Hillary Clinton.
p4010
aVHillary Clinton supported Bill Clinton's disastrous NAFTA, just like she supported China's entrance into the World Trade Organization.
p4011
aV[7]  We've lost nearly one-third of our manufacturing jobs since these two Hillary-backed agreements were signed.
p4012
aV[8]  Our trade deficit with China soared 40% during Hillary Clinton's time as Secretary of State -- a disgraceful performance for which she should not be congratulated, but rather scorned.
p4013
aV[9]  Then she let China steal hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property \u2013 a crime which is continuing to this day.
p4014
aV[10]  Hillary Clinton gave China millions of our best jobs, and effectively let China completely rebuild itself.
p4015
aVIn return, Hillary Clinton got rich!
p4016
aVThe book Clinton Cash, by Peter Schweitzer, documents how Bill and Hillary used the State Department to enrich their family at America's expense.
p4017
aVShe gets rich making you poor.
p4018
aVHere is a quote from the book: "At the center of US policy toward China was Hillary Clinton\u2026at this critical time for US-china relations, Bill Clinton gave a number of speeches that were underwritten by the Chinese government and its supporters."
p4019
aVThese funds were paid to the Clinton bank account while Hillary was negotiating with China on behalf of the United States.
p4020
aV[11]  She sold out our workers, and our country, for Beijing.
p4021
aVHillary Clinton has also been the biggest promoter of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will ship millions more of our jobs overseas \u2013 and give up Congressional power to an international foreign commission.
p4022
aV[12]  Now, because I have pointed out why it would be such a disastrous deal, she is pretending that she is against it.
p4023
aVShe has even deleted this record of total support from her book \u2013 deletion is something she is very good at -- (at least 30,000 emails are missing.
p4024
aV)[13]  But this latest Clinton cover-up doesn't change anything: if she is elected president, she will adopt the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and we will lose millions of jobs and our economic independence for good.
p4025
aVShe will do this, just as she has betrayed the American worker on trade at every single stage of her career \u2013 and it will be even worse than the Clintons' NAFTA deal.
p4026
aVI want trade deals, but they have to be great for the United States and our workers.
p4027
aVWe don't make great deals anymore, but we will once I become president.
p4028
aVIt's not just our economy that's been corrupted, but our foreign policy too.
p4029
aVThe Hillary Clinton foreign policy has cost America thousands of lives and trillions of dollars \u2013 and unleashed ISIS across the world.
p4030
aVNo Secretary of State has been more wrong, more often, and in more places than Hillary Clinton.
p4031
aVHer decisions spread death, destruction and terrorism everywhere she touched.
p4032
aVAmong the victims is our late Ambassador, Chris Stevens.
p4033
aVHe was left helpless to die as Hillary Clinton soundly slept in her bed -- that's right, when the phone rang at 3 o'clock in the morning, she was sleeping.
p4034
aVAmbassador Stevens and his staff in Libya made hundreds of requests for security.
p4035
aV[14]  Hillary Clinton's State Department refused them all.
p4036
aVShe started the war that put him in Libya, denied him the security he asked for, then left him there to die.
p4037
aVTo cover her tracks, Hillary lied about a video being the cause of his death.
p4038
aV[15]  Here is what one of the victim's mothers had to say:  "I want the whole world to know it: she lied to my face, and you don't want this person to be president.
p4039
aV"[16]  In 2009, before Hillary Clinton was sworn in, it was a different world.
p4040
aVLibya was cooperating.
p4041
aVIraq was seeing a reduction in violence.
p4042
aVSyria was under control.
p4043
aVIran was being choked by sanctions.
p4044
aVEgypt was governed by a friendly regime that honored its peace treaty with Israel.
p4045
aVISIS wasn't even on the map.
p4046
aVFast forward to 2013: In just four years, Secretary Clinton managed  to almost single-handedly destabilize the entire Middle East.
p4047
aVHer invasion of Libya handed the country over to the ISIS barbarians.
p4048
aVThanks to Hillary Clinton, Iran is now the dominant Islamic power in the Middle East, and on the road to nuclear weapons.
p4049
aVHillary Clinton's support for violent regime change in Syria has thrown the country into one of the bloodiest civil wars anyone has ever seen \u2013 while giving ISIS a launching pad for terrorism against the West.
p4050
aV[17]  She helped force out a friendly regime in Egypt and replace it with the radical Muslim Brotherhood.
p4051
aVThe Egyptian military has retaken control, but Clinton has opened the Pandora's box of radical Islam.
p4052
aVThen, there was the disastrous strategy of announcing our departure date from Iraq, handing large parts of the country over to ISIS killers.
p4053
aV[18]  ISIS threatens us today because of the decisions Hillary Clinton has made.
p4054
aVISIS also threatens peaceful Muslims across the Middle East, and peaceful Muslims across the world, who have been terribly victimized by horrible brutality \u2013 and who only want to raise their kids in peace and safety.
p4055
aVIn short, Hillary Clinton's tryout for the presidency has produced one deadly foreign policy disaster after another.
p4056
aVIt all started with her bad judgment in supporting the War in Iraq in the first place.
p4057
aV[19]  Though I was not in government service, I was among the earliest to criticize the rush to war, and yes, even before the war ever started.
p4058
aV[20]  But Hillary Clinton learned nothing from Iraq, because when she got into power, she couldn't wait to rush us off to war in Libya.
p4059
aVShe lacks the temperament, the judgment and the competence to lead.
p4060
aVIn the words of a Secret Service agent posted outside the Oval Office:  "She simply lacks the integrity and temperament to serve  in the office\u2026from the bottom of my soul, I know this to be true\u2026Her leadership style \u2013 volcanic, impulsive\u2026disdainful of the rules set for everyone else \u2013 hasn't changed a bit.
p4061
aV"[21]  Perhaps the most terrifying thing about Hillary Clinton's foreign policy is that she refuses to acknowledge the threat posed by Radical Islam.
p4062
aVIn fact, Hillary Clinton supports a radical 550% increase in Syrian refugees coming into the United States, and that's an increase over President Obama's already very high number.
p4063
aV[22]  Under her plan, we would admit hundreds of thousands of refugees from the most dangerous countries on Earth \u2013 with no way to screen who they are or what they believe.
p4064
aV[23] [24]  Already, hundreds of recent immigrants and their children have been convicted of terrorist activity inside the U.S.[25]  The father of the Orlando shooter was a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan, one of the most repressive anti-gay and anti-women regimes on Earth.
p4065
aV[26]  I only want to admit people who share our values and love our people.
p4066
aVHillary Clinton wants to bring in people who believe women should be enslaved and gays put to death.
p4067
aVMaybe her motivation lies among the more than 1,000 foreign donations Hillary failed to disclose while at the State Department.
p4068
aV[27]  Hillary Clinton may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency.
p4069
aVHere is some more of what we learned from the book, Clinton Cash:  A foreign telecom giant faced possible State Department sanctions for providing technology to Iran, and other oppressive regimes.
p4070
aVSo what did this company do?
p4071
aVFor the first time ever, they decided to pay Bill Clinton $750,000 for a single speech.
p4072
aVThe Clintons got their cash, the telecom company escaped sanctions.
p4073
aV[28] Hillary Clinton's State Department approved the transfer of 20% of America's uranium holdings to Russia, while 9 investors in the deal funneled $145 million to the Clinton Foundation.
p4074
aV[29] Hillary Clinton appointed a top donor to a national security board with top secret access \u2013 even though he had no national security credentials.
p4075
aV[30] Hillary Clinton accepted $58,000 in jewelry from the government of Brunei when she was Secretary of State \u2013 plus millions more for her foundation.
p4076
aVThe Sultan of Brunei has pushed oppressive Sharia law, including the punishment of death by stoning for being gay.
p4077
aVThe government of Brunei also stands to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of Hillary's Trans-Pacific Partnership, which she would absolutely approve if given the chance.
p4078
aV[31] Hillary Clinton took up to $25 million from Saudi Arabia, where being gay is also punishable by death.
p4079
aV[32] Hillary took millions from Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and many other countries that horribly abuse women and LGBT citizens.
p4080
aV[33] To cover-up her corrupt dealings, Hillary Clinton illegally stashed her State Department emails on a private server.
p4081
aVHer server was easily hacked by foreign governments \u2013 perhaps even by her financial backers in Communist China \u2013 putting all of America in danger.
p4082
aV[34]  Then there are the 33,000 emails she deleted.
p4083
aV[35]  While we may not know what is in those deleted emails, our enemies probably do.
p4084
aVSo they probably now have a blackmail file over someone who wants to be President of the United States.
p4085
aVThis fact alone disqualifies her from the Presidency.
p4086
aVWe can't hand over our government to someone whose deepest, darkest secrets may be in the hands of our enemies.
p4087
aVNational security is also immigration security \u2013 and Hillary wants neither.
p4088
aVHillary Clinton has put forward the most radical immigration platform in the history of the United States.
p4089
aVShe has pledged to grant mass amnesty and in her first 100 days, end virtually all immigration enforcement, and thus create totally open borders in the United States.
p4090
aV[36]  The first victims of her radical policies will be poor African-American and Hispanic workers who need jobs.
p4091
aVThey are the ones she will hurt the most.
p4092
aVLet me share with you a letter our campaign received from Mary Ann Mendoza.
p4093
aVShe lost her amazing son, Police Sergeant Brandon Mendoza, after he was killed by an illegal immigrant because of the open borders policies supported by Hillary Clinton.
p4094
aV[37]  Sadly, the Mendoza family is just one of thousands who have suffered the same fate.
p4095
aVHere is an excerpt from Mrs. Mendoza's letter:  "Hillary Clinton, who already has the blood of so many on her hands, is now announcing that she is willing to put each and every one of our lives in harms' way \u2013 an open door policy to criminals and terrorists to enter our country.
p4096
aVHillary is not concerned about you or I, she is only concerned about the power the presidency would bring to her.
p4097
aVShe needs to go to prison to pay for the crimes she has already committed against this country."
p4098
aVHillary also wants to spend hundreds of billions to resettle Middle Eastern refugees in the United States, on top of the current record level of immigration.
p4099
aVFor the amount of money Hillary Clinton would like to spend on refugees, we could rebuild every inner city in America.
p4100
aVHillary's Wall Street immigration agenda will keep immigrant communities poor, and unemployed Americans out of work.
p4101
aVShe can't claim to care about African-American and Hispanic workers when she wants to bring in millions of new low-wage workers to compete against them.
p4102
aVHere are a few things a Trump Administration will do for America in the first 100 days:  Appoint judges who will uphold the Constitution.
p4103
aVHillary Clinton's radical judges will virtually abolish the 2nd amendment.
p4104
aVChange immigration rules to give unemployed Americans an opportunity to fill good-paying jobs Stand up to countries that cheat on trade, of which there are many Cancel rules and regulations that send jobs overseas Lift restrictions on energy production Repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare -- it is a disaster.
p4105
aVPass massive tax reform to create millions of new jobs.
p4106
aVImpose tough new ethics rules to restore dignity to the Office of Secretary of State.
p4107
aVThere is one common theme in all of these reforms.
p4108
aVIt's going to be America First.
p4109
aVThis is why the stakes in November are so great.
p4110
aVOn Election Day, the politicians stand trial before the people.
p4111
aVThe voters are the jury.
p4112
aVTheir ballots are the verdict.
p4113
aVWe don't need or want another Clinton or Obama.
p4114
aVCome November, the American people will have a chance to issue a verdict on the politicians that have sacrificed their security, betrayed their prosperity, and sold out their country.
p4115
aVThey will have a chance to vote for a new agenda with big dreams, bold ideas and enormous possibilities for the American people.
p4116
aVHillary Clinton's message is old and tired.
p4117
aVHer message is that can't change.
p4118
aVMy message is that things have to change \u2013 and this is our one chance do it.
p4119
aVThis is our last chance to do it.
p4120
aVAmericans are the people that tamed the West, that dug out the Panama Canal, that sent satellites across the solar system that built the great dams, and so much more.
p4121
aVThen we started thinking small.
p4122
aVWe stopped believing in what America could do, and became reliant on other countries, other people, and other institutions.
p4123
aVWe lost our sense of purpose, and daring.
p4124
aVBut that's not who we are.
p4125
aVCome this November, we can bring America back \u2013 bigger and better, and stronger than ever.
p4126
aVWe will build the greatest infrastructure on the planet earth \u2013 the roads and railways and airports of tomorrow.
p4127
aVOur military will have the best technology and finest equipment \u2013 we will bring it back all the way.
p4128
aVMassive new factories will come roaring into our country \u2013 breathing life and hope into our communities.
p4129
aVInner cities, which have been horribly abused by Hillary Clinton and the Democrat Party, will finally be rebuilt.
p4130
aVConstruction is what I know -- nobody knows it better.
p4131
aVThe real wages for our workers have not been raised for 18 years -- but these wages will start going up, along with the new jobs.
p4132
aVHillary's massive taxation, regulation and open borders will destroy jobs and drive down wages for everyone.
p4133
aVWe are also going to be supporting our police and law enforcement -- we can never forget the great job they do.
p4134
aVI am also going to appoint great Supreme Court Justices.
p4135
aVOur country is going to start working again.
p4136
aVPeople are going to start working again.
p4137
aVParents are going to start dreaming big for their children again \u2013 including parents in our inner cities.
p4138
aVAmericans are going to start believing in the future or our country.
p4139
aVWe are going to make America rich again.
p4140
aVWe are going to make America safe again.
p4141
aVWe are going to make America Great Again \u2013 and Great Again For EVERYONE.

aVCrooked Hillary Clinton has proposed debt-free college, but her plans would have the opposite effect and actually increase tuition, pushing student debt even higher.
p4170
aVThe Federal Reserve Bank Of New York Released A Study Detailing How Increases In Tuition Are Tied To Increases In Student Loan Availability.
p4171
aV"When students fund their education through loans, changes in student borrowing and tuition are interlinked.
p4172
aVHigher tuition costs raise loan demand, but loan supply also affects equilibrium tuition costs\u2014for example, by relaxing students' funding constraints."

p4174
aV"We find that institutions more exposed to changes in the subsidized federal loan program increased their tuition disproportionately around these policy changes, with a sizable pass-through effect on tuition of about 65 percent."

aVDONALD J. TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT- CAMPAIGN STATEMENT:  The month of June represents the first full month of fundraising activity for the campaign and this will be reflected in the June FEC report.
p4238
aVThe campaign held its first campaign fundraising event on May 25th, 2016.
p4239
aVTo date, the campaign's fundraising has been incredible and we continue to see a tremendous outpouring of support for Mr. Trump and money to the Republican Party.
p4240
aVThe positive response to our fundraising efforts so far is a further indication that the country does not want yet another corrupt politician like Crooked Hillary.
p4241
aVMr. Trump added, "If need be, there could be unlimited "cash on hand" as I would put up my own money, as I have already done through the primaries, spending over $50 million dollars.
p4242
aVOur campaign is leaner and more efficient, like our government should be."
p4243
aVCrooked Hillary Clinton is totally unfit to be our president- really bad judgement and a temperament, according to new book, which is a mess!

aVMy plan will end waste, fraud and abuse at the VA!

aVSTATEMENT ON AFL-CIO ENDORSEMENT OF HILLARY CLINTON  Sadly with this endorsement of Hillary Clinton - who is totally owned by Wall Street - the leadership of the AFL-CIO has made clear that it no longer represents American workers.
p4298
aVInstead they have become part of the rigged system in Washington, D.C. that benefits only the insiders.
p4299
aVI believe their members will be voting for me in much larger numbers than for her.
p4300
aVHillary Clinton and her husband have made hundreds of millions of dollars doing favors and selling access to Wall Street, special interests and oppressive foreign regimes.
p4301
aVAs Bernie Sanders said, "Why, over her political career, has Wall Street been the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton?"
p4302
aVThey own Hillary Clinton and she will do whatever they tell her to.
p4303
aVBernie Sanders is also 100% correct when he says that Hillary Clinton "vote[d] for virtually every trade agreement that has cost the workers of this country millions of jobs."
p4304
aVHillary supported NAFTA and she supported the trade deal with China, Vietnam, South Korea \u2013 and if elected will implement the TPP she loves so much \u2013 guaranteed.
p4305
aVWhile Secretary of State,'Hillary Clinton racked up a $1 trillion trade deficit with China \u2013 all while China was funneling a small fortune to Hillary via speaking fees paid to Bill.
p4306
aVOn immigration, Hillary Clinton sides with Wall Street too.
p4307
aVBernie Sanders correctly warned that open borders "would substantially lower wages in this country," and yet Hillary has put forward a plan that would completely open America's borders in her first 100 days in office.
p4308
aVOn energy, Hillary Clinton wants to shut down the coal mines, block the Keystone pipeline, and destroy millions of good union jobs through executive action.
p4309
aVHer massive proposed increase in taxes and regulations will also send millions of jobs overseas.
p4310
aVHillary Clinton will economically destroy poor communities, African-American and Hispanic workers on trade, immigration, crime, energy, taxes, regulation and everything else.
p4311
aVFinally, union workers have long believed in having an open and free society.
p4312
aVYet Hillary takes money from regimes that support the murder of gays and the enslavement of women while pushing to bring people into America who want to do the exact same thing to our people.
p4313
aVI only want to bring people into our country who will love and support everyone.
p4314
aVHillary Clinton is the enemy of working people and is the best friend Wall Street ever had.
p4315
aVI will fight harder for American workers than anyone ever has, and I will fight for their right to elect leaders who will do the same.
p4316
aVI will be a president for ALL Americans.

aVSince the moment I rode down the escalator on June 16th, 2015, and decided to run for President, my campaign has been filled with nothing but excitement, dedication, and passion to change our country for the better \u2013 this is only the beginning of our movement.
p4330
aVI am honored and proud to lead our fight to put America first.
p4331
aVThis past year, I have travelled this great country and met many incredible Americans at our rallies.
p4332

p4333

p4334
aVThe Republican primary began with 17 experienced and talented candidates for President.
p4335
aVAt the Ronald Reagan Library on September 16th, your overwhelming support showed that our campaign had the message that resonated with hard- working Americans, and that DC-centric way of thinking is no longer capable of leading our country.
p4336
aVMy campaign has been one of honesty and substance.
p4337
aVWe have created much-needed dialogue around the important issues facing our country.
p4338
aVYou've seen my leadership in setting the agenda this whole political season, on both sides of the aisle.
p4339
aVWe wouldn't be talking about illegal immigration.
p4340
aVWe wouldn't be talking about the drugs pouring in and the bad trade deals costing American jobs.
p4341
aVWe wouldn't have called the terrorist attack in Orlando for what it is: radical Islamic terrorism.
p4342
aVPoliticians are all talk and no action.
p4343
aVThe support of many wonderful Americans, led to resounding victories in the Republican Primary race, in which we beat the rigged political system and biased media with landslide victories.
p4344
aVOur success began on February 9th, with an emphatic win in New Hampshire and reached a high point with our victory in South Carolina on February 20th.
p4345
aVWe had some tough losses along the way, but with your support we were able to bounce back and sweep the Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island on April 26th, along with other monumental wins throughout the primary season.
p4346
aVThe best of which was our win in Indiana on May 3rd, which led to us being declared the presumptive nominee and make history!
p4347
aVThe strong vote of confidence that American voters have placed in our message of Making America Great Again, has buoyed us to many victories and is truly heartwarming.
p4348
aVWhile we are thankful for the phenomenal success we have enjoyed in the past year, we are just beginning!
p4349
aVI could not be more thrilled as your presumptive Republican Presidential Nominee and to officially accept the GOP Nomination at the Convention in July.
p4350

aVDONALD J. TRUMP ADDRESSES TERRORISM, IMMIGRATION, AND NATIONAL SECURITY  Thank you for joining me today.
p4396
aVThis was going to be a speech on Hillary Clinton and how bad a President, especially in these times of Radical Islamic Terrorism, she would be.
p4397
aVEven her former Secret Service Agent, who has seen her under pressure and in times of stress, has stated that she lacks the temperament and integrity to be president.
p4398
aVThere will be plenty of opportunity to discuss these important issues at a later time, and I will deliver that speech soon.
p4399
aVBut today there is only one thing to discuss: the growing threat of terrorism inside of our borders.
p4400
aVThe attack on the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando, Florida, was the worst terrorist strike on our soil since September 11th, and the worst mass shooting in our country's history.
p4401
aVSo many people dead, so many people gravely injured, so much carnage, such a disgrace.
p4402
aVThe horror is beyond description.
p4403
aVThe families of these wonderful people are totally devastated.
p4404
aVLikewise, our whole nation, and indeed the whole world, is devastated.
p4405
aVWe express our deepest sympathies to the victims, the wounded, and their families.
p4406
aVWe mourn, as one people, for our nation's loss \u2013 and pledge our support to any and all who need it.
p4407
aVI would like to ask now that we all observe a moment of silence for the victims of the attack.
p4408
aVOur nation stands together in solidarity with the members of Orlando's LGBT Community.
p4409
aVThis is a very dark moment in America's history.
p4410
aVA radical Islamic terrorist targeted the nightclub not only because he wanted to kill Americans, but in order to execute gay and lesbian citizens because of their sexual orientation.
p4411
aVIt is a strike at the heart and soul of who we are as a nation.
p4412
aVIt is an assault on the ability of free people to live their lives, love who they want and express their identity.
p4413
aVIt is an attack on the right of every single American to live in peace and safety in their own country.
p4414
aVWe need to respond to this attack on America as one united people \u2013 with force, purpose and determination.
p4415
aVBut the current politically correct response cripples our ability to talk and think and act clearly.
p4416
aVIf we don't get tough, and we don't get smart \u2013 and fast \u2013 we're not going to have a country anymore -- there will be nothing left.
p4417
aVThe killer, whose name I will not use, or ever say, was born to Afghan parents who immigrated to the United States.
p4418
aVHis father published support for the Afghan Taliban, a regime which murders those who don't share its radical views.
p4419
aVThe father even said he was running for President of that country.
p4420
aVThe bottom line is that the only reason the killer was in America in the first place was because we allowed his family to come here.
p4421
aVThat is a fact, and it's a fact we need to talk about.
p4422
aVWe have a dysfunctional immigration system which does not permit us to know who we let into our country, and it does not permit us to protect our citizens.
p4423
aVWe have an incompetent administration, and if I am not elected President, that will not change over the next four years -- but it must change, and it must change now.
p4424
aVWith fifty people dead, and dozens more wounded, we cannot afford to talk around the issue anymore -- we have to address it head on.
p4425
aVI called for a ban after San Bernardino, and was met with great scorn and anger but now, many are saying I was right to do so -- and although the pause is temporary, we must find out what is going on.
p4426
aVThe ban will be lifted when we as a nation are in a position to properly and perfectly screen those people coming into our country.
p4427
aVThe immigration laws of the United States give the President the power to suspend entry into the country of any class of persons that the President deems detrimental to the interests or security of the United States, as he deems appropriate.
p4428
aVI will use this power to protect the American people.
p4429
aVWhen I am elected, I will suspend immigration from areas of the world when there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies, until we understand how to end these threats.
p4430
aVAfter a full, impartial and long overdue security assessment, we will develop a responsible immigration policy that serves the interests and values of America.
p4431
aVWe cannot continue to allow thousands upon thousands of people to pour into our country, many of whom have the same thought process as this savage killer.
p4432
aVMany of the principles of Radical Islam are incompatible with Western values and institutions.
p4433
aVRadical Islam is anti-woman, anti-gay and anti-American.
p4434
aVI refuse to allow America to become a place where gay people, Christian people, and Jewish people, are the targets of persecution and intimidation by Radical Islamic preachers of hate and violence.
p4435
aVIt's not just a national security issue.
p4436
aVIt is a quality of life issue.
p4437
aVIf we want to protect the quality of life for all Americans \u2013 women and children, gay and straight, Jews and Christians and all people \u2013 then we need to tell the truth about Radical Islam.
p4438
aVWe need to tell the truth, also, about how Radical Islam is coming to our shores.
p4439
aVWe are importing Radical Islamic Terrorism into the West through a failed immigration system -- and through an intelligence community held back by our president.
p4440
aVEven our own FBI Director has admitted that we cannot effectively check the backgrounds of the people we are letting into America.
p4441
aVAll of the September 11th hijackers were issued visas.
p4442
aVLarge numbers of Somali refugees in Minnesota have tried to join ISIS.
p4443
aVThe Boston Bombers came here through political asylum.
p4444
aVThe male shooter in San Bernardino \u2013 again, whose name I won't mention -- was the child of immigrants from Pakistan, and he brought his wife \u2013 the other terrorist - from Saudi Arabia, through another one of our easily exploited visa programs.
p4445
aVImmigration from Afghanistan into the United States has increased nearly five-fold in just one year.
p4446
aVAccording to Pew Research, 99% of people in Afghanistan support oppressive Sharia Law.
p4447
aVWe admit many more from other countries in the region who share these same oppressive views.
p4448
aVIf we want to remain a free and open society, then we have to control our borders.
p4449
aVYet, Hillary Clinton \u2013 for months and despite so many attacks \u2013 repeatedly refused to even say the words "radical Islam," until I challenged her yesterday to say the words or leave the race.
p4450
aVHowever, Hillary Clinton \u2013 who has been forced to say the words today after policies she supports have caused us so much damage \u2013 still has no clue what Radical Islam is, and won't speak honestly about what it is.
p4451
aVShe is in total denial, and her continuing reluctance to ever name the enemy broadcasts weakness across the world.
p4452
aVIn fact, just a few weeks before the San Bernardino slaughter, Hillary Clinton explained her refusal to say the words Radical Islam.
p4453
aVHere is what she said: "Muslims are peaceful and tolerant people, and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism."
p4454
aVHillary Clinton says the solution is to ban guns.
p4455
aVThey tried that in France, which has among the toughest gun laws in the world, and 130 were brutally murdered by Islamic terrorists in cold blood.
p4456
aVHer plan is to disarm law-abiding Americans, abolishing the 2nd amendment, and leaving only the bad guys and terrorists with guns.
p4457
aVShe wants to take away Americans' guns, then admit the very people who want to slaughter us.
p4458
aVI will be meeting with the NRA, which has given me their earliest endorsement in a Presidential race, to discuss how to ensure Americans have the means to protect themselves in this age of terror.
p4459
aVThe bottom line is that Hillary supports the policies that bring the threat of Radical Islam into America, and allow it to grow overseas.
p4460
aVIn fact, Hillary Clinton's catastrophic immigration plan will bring vastly more Radical Islamic immigration into this country, threatening not only our security but our way of life.
p4461
aVWhen it comes to Radical Islamic terrorism, ignorance is not bliss \u2013 it's deadly.
p4462
aVThe Obama Administration, with the support of Hillary Clinton and others, has also damaged our security by restraining our intelligence-gathering and failing to support law enforcement.
p4463
aVThey have put political correctness above common sense, above your safety, and above all else.
p4464
aVI refuse to be politically correct.
p4465
aVI will do the right thing--I want to straighten things out and to Make America Great Again.
p4466
aVThe days of deadly ignorance will end, and they will end soon.
p4467
aVAs President I will give our intelligence community, law enforcement and military the tools they need to prevent terrorist attacks.
p4468
aVWe need an intelligence-gathering system second to none.
p4469
aVThat includes better cooperation between state, local and federal officials \u2013 and with our allies.
p4470
aVI will have an Attorney General, a Director of National Intelligence, and a Secretary of Defense who will know how to fight the war on Radical Islamic Terrorism \u2013 and who will have the support they require to get the job done.
p4471
aVWe also must ensure the American people are provided the information they need to understand the threat.
p4472
aVThe Senate Subcommittee on Immigration has already identified hundreds of immigrants charged with terrorist activities inside the United States since September 11th.
p4473
aVNearly a year ago, the Senate Subcommittee asked President Obama's Departments of Justice, State and Homeland Security to provide the immigration history of all terrorists inside the United States.
p4474
aVThese Departments refused to comply.
p4475
aVPresident Obama must release the full and complete immigration histories of all individuals implicated in terrorist activity of any kind since 9/11.
p4476
aVThe public has a right to know how these people got here.
p4477
aVWe have to screen applicants to know whether they are affiliated with, or support, radical groups and beliefs.
p4478
aVWe have to control the amount of future immigration into this country to prevent large pockets of radicalization from forming inside America.
p4479
aVEven a single individual can be devastating, just look at what happened in Orlando.
p4480
aVCan you imagine large groups?
p4481
aVTruly, our President doesn't know what he is doing.
p4482
aVHe has failed us, and failed us badly, and under his leadership, this situation will not get any better -- it will only get worse.
p4483
aVEach year, the United States permanently admits more than 100,000 immigrants from the Middle East, and many more from Muslim countries outside the Middle East.
p4484
aVOur government has been admitting ever-growing numbers, year after year, without any effective plan for our security.
p4485
aVIn fact, Clinton's State Department was in charge of the admissions process for people applying to enter from overseas.
p4486
aVHaving learned nothing from these attacks, she now plans to massively increase admissions without a screening plan, including a 500% increase in Syrian refugees.
p4487
aVThis could be a better, bigger version of the legendary Trojan Horse.
p4488
aVWe can't let this happen.
p4489
aVAltogether, under the Clinton plan, you'd be admitting hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Middle East with no system to vet them, or to prevent the radicalization of their children.
p4490
aVThe burden is on Hillary Clinton to tell us why she believes immigration from these dangerous countries should be increased without any effective system to screen who we are bringing in.
p4491
aVThe burden is on Hillary Clinton to tell us why we should admit anyone into our country who supports violence of any kind against gay and lesbian Americans.
p4492
aVThe burden is also on Hillary Clinton to tell us how she will pay for it.
p4493
aVHer plan will cost Americans hundreds of billions of dollars long-term.
p4494
aVWouldn't this money be better spent on rebuilding America for our current population, including the many poor people already living here?
p4495
aVWe have to stop the tremendous flow of Syrian refugees into the United States \u2013 we don't know who they are, they have no documentation, and we don't know what they're planning.
p4496
aVWhat I want is common sense.
p4497
aVI want a mainstream immigration policy that promotes American values.
p4498
aVThat is the choice I put before the American people: a mainstream immigration policy designed to benefit America, or Hillary Clinton's radical immigration policy designed to benefit politically-correct special interests.
p4499
aVWe've got to get smart, and tough, and vigilant, and we've got to do it now, because later is too late.
p4500
aVThe media talks about "homegrown," terrorism, but Islamic radicalism, and the networks that nurture it, are imports from overseas.
p4501
aVYes, there are many radicalized people already inside our country as a result of the poor policies of the past.
p4502
aVBut the whole point is that it will be much, much easier to deal with our current problem if we don't keep on bringing in people who add to the problem.
p4503
aVFor instance, the controversial Mosque attended by the Boston Bombers had as its founder an immigrant from overseas charged in an assassination plot.
p4504
aVThis shooter in Orlando was the child of an immigrant father who supported one of the most repressive regimes on Earth.
p4505
aVWhy would we admit people who support violent hatred?
p4506
aVHillary Clinton can never claim to be a friend of the gay community as long as she continues to support immigration policies that bring Islamic extremists to our country who suppress women, gays and anyone who doesn't share their views.
p4507
aVShe can't have it both ways.
p4508
aVShe can't claim to be supportive of these communities while trying to increase the number of people coming in who want to oppress them.
p4509
aVHow does this kind of immigration make our life better?
p4510
aVHow does this kind of immigration make our country better?
p4511
aVWhy does Hillary Clinton want to bring people here\u2014in vast numbers\u2014who reject our values?
p4512
aVAsk yourself, who is really the friend of women and the LGBT community, Donald Trump with his actions, or Hillary Clinton with her words?
p4513
aVClinton wants to allow Radical Islamic terrorists to pour into our country\u2014they enslave women, and murder gays.
p4514
aVI don't want them in our country.
p4515
aVImmigration is a privilege, and we should not let anyone into this country who doesn't support our communities \u2013 all of our communities.
p4516
aVAmerica has already admitted four times more immigrants than any country on earth, and we continue to admit millions more with no real checks or scrutiny.
p4517
aVNot surprisingly, wages for our workers haven't budged in many years.
p4518
aVSo whether it's matter of national security, or financial security, we can't afford to keep on going like this.
p4519
aVWe owe $19 trillion in debt, and no longer have options.
p4520
aVAll our communities, from all backgrounds, are ready for some relief.
p4521
aVThis is not an act of offense against anyone; it is an act of defense.
p4522
aVI want us all to work together, including in partnership with our Muslim communities.
p4523
aVBut Muslim communities must cooperate with law enforcement and turn in the people who they know are bad \u2013 and they do know where they are.
p4524
aVI want to fix our schools, roads, bridges and job market.
p4525
aVI want every American to succeed.
p4526
aVHillary Clinton wants to empty out the Treasury to bring people into the country that include individuals who preach hate against our own citizens.
p4527
aVI want to protect our citizens \u2013 all of our citizens.
p4528
aVThe terrorist attack on the Pulse Night Club demands a full and complete investigation into every aspect of the assault.
p4529
aVIn San Bernardino, as an example, people knew what was going on, but they used the excuse of racial profiling for not reporting it.
p4530
aVWe need to know what the killer discussed with his relatives, parents, friends and associates.
p4531
aVWe need to know if he was affiliated with any radical Mosques or radical activists and what, if any, is their immigration status.
p4532
aVWe need to know if he travelled anywhere, and who he travelled with.
p4533
aVWe need to make sure every single last person involved in this plan \u2013 including anyone who knew something but didn't tell us \u2013 is brought to justice.
p4534
aVIf it can be proven that somebody had information about any attack, and did not give this information to authorities, they must serve prison time .
p4535
aVAmerica must do more \u2013 much more \u2013 to protect its citizens, especially people who are potential victims of crimes based on their backgrounds or sexual orientations.
p4536
aVIt also means we must change our foreign policy.
p4537
aVThe decision to overthrow the regime in Libya, then pushing for the overthrow of the regime in Syria, among other things, without plans for the day after, have created space for ISIS to expand and grow.
p4538
aVThese actions, along with our disastrous Iran deal, have also reduced our ability to work in partnership with our Muslim allies in the region.
p4539
aVThat is why our new goal must be to defeat Islamic terrorism, not nation-building.
p4540
aVFor instance, the last major NATO mission was Hillary Clinton's war in Libya.
p4541
aVThat mission helped unleash ISIS on a new continent.
p4542
aVI've said NATO needs to change its focus to stopping terrorism.
p4543
aVSince I've raised that criticism, NATO has since announced a new initiative focused on just that.
p4544
aVAmerica must unite the whole civilized world in the fight against Islamic terrorism, just like we did against communism in the Cold War.
p4545
aVWe've tried it President Obama's way.
p4546
aVHe gave the world his apology tour, we got ISIS, and many other problems, in return.
p4547
aVI'd like to conclude my remarks today by again expressing our solidarity with the people of Orlando who have come under attack.
p4548
aVWhen I am President, I pledge to protect and defend all Americans who live inside of our borders.
p4549
aVWherever they come from, wherever they were born, all Americans living here and following our laws will be protected.
p4550
aVAmerica will be a tolerant and open society.
p4551
aVAmerica will also be a safe society.
p4552
aVWe will protect our borders at home.
p4553
aVWe will defeat ISIS overseas.
p4554
aVWe will ensure every parent can raise their children in peace and safety.
p4555
aVWe will make America rich again.
p4556
aVWe will make America safe again.
p4557
aVWe will make American Great Again.
p4558
aVThank you.

aVDONALD J. TRUMP STATEMENT REGARDING TRAGIC TERRORIST ATTACK IN ORLANDO, FLORIDA  Last night, our nation was attacked by a radical Islamic terrorist.
p4566
aVIt was the worst terrorist attack on our soil since 9/11, and the second of its kind in 6 months.
p4567
aVMy deepest sympathy and support goes out to the victims, the wounded, and their families.
p4568
aVIn his remarks today, President Obama disgracefully refused to even say the words 'Radical Islam'.
p4569
aVFor that reason alone, he should step down.
p4570
aVIf Hillary Clinton, after this attack, still cannot say the two words 'Radical Islam' she should get out of this race for the Presidency.
p4571
aVIf we do not get tough and smart real fast, we are not going to have a country anymore.
p4572
aVBecause our leaders are weak, I said this was going to happen \u2013 and it is only going to get worse.
p4573
aVI am trying to save lives and prevent the next terrorist attack.
p4574
aVWe can't afford to be politically correct anymore.
p4575
aVThe terrorist, Omar Mir Saddique Mateen, is the son of an immigrant from Afghanistan who openly published his support for the Afghanistani Taliban and even tried to run for President of Afghanistan.
p4576
aVAccording to Pew, 99% of people in Afghanistan support oppressive Sharia Law.
p4577
aVWe admit more than 100,000 lifetime migrants from the Middle East each year.
p4578
aVSince 9/11, hundreds of migrants and their children have been implicated in terrorism in the United States.
p4579
aVHillary Clinton wants to dramatically increase admissions from the Middle East, bringing in many hundreds of thousands during a first term \u2013 and we will have no way to screen them, pay for them, or prevent the second generation from radicalizing.
p4580
aVWe need to protect all Americans, of all backgrounds and all beliefs, from Radical Islamic Terrorism - which has no place in an open and tolerant society.
p4581
aVRadical Islam advocates hate for women, gays, Jews, Christians and all Americans.
p4582
aVI am going to be a President for all Americans, and I am going to protect and defend all Americans.
p4583
aVWe are going to make America safe again and great again for everyone.
p4584
aV- Donald J. Trump
p4585
aVWhat has happened in Orlando is just the beginning.
p4586
aVOur leadership is weak and ineffective.
p4587
aVI called it and asked for the ban.
p4588
aVMust be tough!
p4589
aVIs President Obama going to finally mention the words radical Islamic terrorism?
p4590
aVIf he doesn't he should immediately resign in disgrace!
p4591
aVWhile I greatly appreciate everybody congratulating me for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I don't want congratulations, I want toughness and vigilance.
p4592
aVWe must finally be smart!
p4593

aVHillary is CROOKED!
p4599
aVShe is not capable of making America great again.
p4600
aVSadly, she would do the opposite.

aVTHROWBACK THURSDAY:
p4626
aVI condemn, in the strongest possible terms, the outrageous terrorist shootings that took the lives of at least four innocent civilians and wounded at least twenty others in Tel Aviv yesterday.
p4627
aVThe Israeli security forces' investigation is ongoing, but some facts have already emerged \u2014 and they are grim.
p4628
aVJust as fast as the condolences arrive from the civilized world is the praise arising out of the uncivilized one.
p4629
aVHamas praised the attack, calling the attackers "heroes."
p4630
aVReports out of Hebron indicate that residents of the terrorists' hometown lit up the night sky with celebratory fireworks.
p4631
aVOne Palestinian "news organization" even referred to the shootings, in which the assailants dressed up as observant Jews, as a "Ramadan treat."
p4632
aVThe leader of Hamas called the injured terrorist a "hero."
p4633
aVHow despicable!
p4634
aVThe American people stand strong with the people of Israel, who have suffered far too long from terrorism.
p4635
aVIsrael's security is a matter of paramount importance to me and the American people.
p4636
aVWe understand all too well the unspeakable horror that terrorism unleashes.
p4637
aVTo address it \u2014 and address it we must!
p4638
aV\u2014 we must recognize the parallel horror of the culture of religious hatred that permeates many Palestinian quarters.
p4639
aVFrom schools that indoctrinate toddlers to grow up to kill Israelis to the daily menu of hate that spews forth from various "news organizations," change is long overdue in the Palestinian territories.
p4640
aVLet us begin the arduous task of creating a future where peace can take root and terror finds no refuge.
p4641
aVI express my deepest condolences to the families of the four Israelis who were murdered, as well as my wishes for a speedy recovery to the wounded.
p4642
aVDonald J. Trump
p4643
aVObama just endorsed Crooked Hillary.
p4644
aVHe wants four more years of Obama\u2014but nobody else does!
p4645
aVI could not do it without you, America!
p4646
aVThis is a MOVEMENT to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
p4647
aVThank you for your amazing support.
p4648
aVIn the end, you're measured not by how much you undertake but by what you finally accomplish.
p4649
aVDonald J. Trump
p4650
aVI am honored by your support.
p4651
aVTogether, we accomplished what nobody thought was possible \u2013 and we're only getting started.
p4652
aVOur campaign received more primary votes than any GOP campaign in history.
p4653
aVThis is not a testament to me, but a testament to all the people like you who believed real change is possible.
p4654
aVI would like to thank the amazing volunteers across the United States- who helped us secure the nomination as well.
p4655
aVI love you!
p4656
aVWe have received wide spread support, winning 37 states from New Hampshire, to Alabama, to California and everywhere in between.
p4657
aVYou have given me the honor to lead the Republican Party to victory this fall, and I won't let you down.
p4658
aVI will make you proud of your party, our movement and most importantly, our country.
p4659
aVTo everyone who voted for me throughout this campaign: thank you.
p4660
aVMy message continues to resonate and I know that my vision for the country is one that will make us stronger and better than ever before.
p4661
aVNow more than ever we must be smart, we must be vigilant, and we must be tough.
p4662
aVEvery day moving forward \u2013 we must work to bring about all of the changes necessary to put an end to the destruction caused by the current administration.
p4663
aVI am going to be the best jobs President God ever created!
p4664
aVWe are going to revitalize our economy, rebuild our infrastructure, repeal and replace ObamaCare, strengthen our military, defeat ISIS, end illegal immigration and put America first!

aVThis is a movement - it's about common sense and doing the right thing.
p4666

p4694
aVSTATEMENT REGARDING TRUMP UNIVERSITY  It is unfortunate that my comments have been misconstrued as a categorical attack against people of Mexican heritage.
p4695
aVI am friends with and employ thousands of people of Mexican and Hispanic descent.
p4696
aVThe American justice system relies on fair and impartial judges.
p4697
aVAll judges should be held to that standard.
p4698
aVI do not feel that one's heritage makes them incapable of being impartial, but, based on the rulings that I have received in the Trump University civil case, I feel justified in questioning whether I am receiving a fair trial.
p4699
aVOver the past few weeks, I have watched as the media has reported one inaccuracy after another concerning the ongoing litigation involving Trump University.
p4700
aVThere are several important facts the public should know and that the media has failed to report.
p4701
aVThroughout the litigation my attorneys have continually demonstrated that students who participated in Trump University were provided a substantive, valuable education based upon a curriculum developed by professors from Northwestern University, Columbia Business School, Stanford University and other respected institutions.
p4702
aVAnd, the response from students was overwhelming.
p4703
aVOver a five year period, more than 10,000 paying students filled out surveys giving the courses high marks and expressing their overwhelming satisfaction with Trump University's programs.
p4704
aVFor example:  Former student Tarla Makaeff, the original plaintiff in the litigation, not only completed multiple surveys rating Trump University's three-day seminar "excellent" in every category, but also praised Trump University's mentorship program in a glowing 5 plus minute video testimonial.
p4705
aVWhen asked "how could Trump University help to meet [her] goals", she simply stated "[c]ontinue to offer great classes."
p4706
aVOnce the plaintiffs' lawyers realized how disastrous a witness she was, they asked to have her removed from the case.
p4707
aVOver my lawyers' objections, the judge granted the plaintiffs' motion, but allowed the case to continue.
p4708
aVArt Cohen, a lead plaintiffs in the litigation, completed a survey in which he not only rated Trump University's three-day seminar "excellent" in virtually every category, but went so far as to indicate that he would "attend another Trump University seminar" and even "recommend Trump University seminars to a friend."
p4709
aVWhen asked how Trump University could improve the seminar, Mr. Cohen's only suggestion was to "[h]ave lunch sandwiches brought in" and make the lunch break 45 minutes.
p4710
aVFormer student Bob Giullo, who has been critical of Trump University in numerous interviews and negative advertisements from my political opponents, also expressed his satisfaction, rating Trump University's programs "excellent" in every category.
p4711
aVWhen asked how Trump University could improve its programs, Mr. Giullo simply asked that students be provided "more comfortable chairs."
p4712
aVIndeed, these are just a few of literally thousands of positive surveys, all of which can be viewed online at www.98percentapproval.com.
p4713
aVFor those students who decided that Trump University's programs were not for them, the company had a generous refund policy, offering a full refund to any student who asked for their money back within 3 days of signing up for a program or by the end of the first day of any multi-day program, whichever came later.

p4721
aVIt is a fair question.
p4722
aVI hope it is not the case.
p4723
aVWhile this lawsuit should have been dismissed, it is now scheduled for trial in November.

p5260
aVIf I got beaten as badly as I beat him, and all the other candidates he endorsed, I would not be able to give my support either.
p5261
aVEvery time I see Lindsey Graham spew hate during interviews I ask why the media never questions how I single-handedly destroyed his hapless run for President.
p5262
aVAs a candidate who did not receive 1% in his own state - compared to my victory at nearly 40% with many others in the race - he has zero credibility.
p5263
aVHe was a poor representative and an embarrassment to the great people of South Carolina.
p5264
aVJudging by the incompetent way he ran his campaign, it is easy to see why his military strategies have failed so badly --- we can't even beat ISIS!
p5265

p5530

p5536
aVDONALD J. TRUMP RESPONSE TO CRUZ AND KASICH CAMPAIGNS  It is sad that two grown politicians have to collude against one person who has only been a politician for ten months in order to try and stop that person from getting the Republican nomination.
p5537
aVSenator Cruz has done very poorly and after his New York performance, which was a total disaster, he is in free fall and as everyone has seen, he does not react well under pressure.
p5538
aVAlso, approximately 80% of the Republican Party is against him.
p5539
aVGovernor Kasich, who has only won 1 state out of 41, in other words, he is 1 for 41 and he is not even doing as well as other candidates who could have stubbornly stayed in the race like him but chose not to do so.
p5540
aVMarco Rubio, as an example, has more delegates than Kasich and yet suspended his campaign one month ago.
p5541
aVOthers, likewise, have done much better than Kasich, who would get slaughtered by Hillary Clinton once the negative ads against him begin.
p5542
aV85% of Republican voters are against Kasich.
p5543
aVCollusion is often illegal in many other industries and yet these two Washington insiders have had to revert to collusion in order to stay alive.
p5544
aVThey are mathematically dead and this act only shows, as puppets of donors and special interests, how truly weak they and their campaigns are.
p5545
aVI have brought millions of voters into the Republican primary system and have received many millions of votes more than Cruz or Kasich.
p5546
aVAdditionally, I am far ahead of both candidates with delegates and would be receiving in excess of 60% of the vote except for the fact that there were so many candidates running against me.
p5547
aVBecause of me, everyone now sees that the Republican primary system is totally rigged.
p5548
aVWhen two candidates who have no path to victory get together to stop a candidate who is expanding the party by millions of voters, (all of whom will drop out if I am not in the race) it is yet another example of everything that is wrong in Washington and our political system.
p5549
aVThis horrible act of desperation, from two campaigns who have totally failed, makes me even more determined, for the good of the Republican Party and our country, to prevail!
p5550
aVWow, just announced that Lyin' Ted and Kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the Republican nomination.
p5551
aVDESPERATION!
p5552
aVThey are both mathematically dead and totally desperate.
p5553
aVTheir donors & special interest groups are not happy with them.
p5554
aVSad!
p5555
aVBoth Ted Cruz and John Kasich have no path to victory.
p5556
aVThey should both drop out of the race so that the Republican Party can unify!
p5557
aVUnbelievable - Hagerstown, Maryland!
p5558
aVThank you for the energy & love today!

aVCAMPAIGN STATEMENT:  Donald J. Trump withstood the onslaught of the establishment yet again.
p5965
aVLyin' Ted Cruz had the Governor of Wisconsin, many conservative talk radio show hosts, and the entire party apparatus behind him.
p5966
aVNot only was he propelled by the anti-Trump Super PAC's spending countless millions of dollars on false advertising against Mr. Trump, but he was coordinating `with his own Super PAC's (which is illegal) who totally control him.
p5967
aVTed Cruz is worse than a puppet--- he is a Trojan horse, being used by the party bosses attempting to steal the nomination from Mr. Trump.
p5968
aVWe have total confidence that Mr. Trump will go on to win in New York, where he holds a substantial lead in all the polls, and beyond.
p5969
aVMr. Trump is the only candidate who can secure the delegates needed to win the Republican nomination and ultimately defeat Hillary Clinton, or whomever is the Democratic nominee, in order to Make America Great Again.
p5970
aVWE ARE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA SAFE & GREAT AGAIN!

aVMr. Trump Prepares for Republican Convention - Seasoned Operative Joins As Convention Manager  (New York, NY) March 29th, 2016 \u2013 Today Donald J. Trump announced that Paul J. Manafort will serve as his campaign's Convention Manager.
p6130
aVMr. Manafort is volunteering his considerable insight and expertise because of his belief that Mr. Trump is the right person for these difficult times.
p6131
aVHe will be responsible for transitioning the Trump campaign's activities as they relate to Mr. Trump's nomination at the convention in Cleveland, Ohio.
p6132
aVMr. Manafort's experience spans over three decades of working on U.S. presidential campaigns, and includes work on conventions for Presidents Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, and George H.W.
p6133
aVBush, as well as Republican Presidential nominee, Bob Dole.
p6134
aVMr. Trump will use Mr. Manafort's years of experience to support his efforts in all aspects of the convention as he closes in on the Republican nomination for President.
p6135
aVCurrently, Mr. Manafort is an attorney and founding partner of DMP International, LLC where he has been active in business and international affairs for the last 20 years.
p6136
aVPreviously, he was a partner at BMS&K for 15 years and worked on dozens of international political campaigns in an effort to bring democratic expertise to foreign countries.
p6137
aVHe served as a director of OPIC following his appointment by President Reagan, and was on the Investment Policy Advisory Committee at the Office of the US Trade Representative.
p6138
aVMr. Trump stated, "Paul is a great asset and an important addition as we consolidate the tremendous support we have received in the primaries and caucuses, garnering millions more votes than any other candidate.
p6139
aVPaul Manafort, and the team I am building, bring the needed skill sets to ensure that the will of the Republican voters, not the Washington political establishment, determines who will be the nominee for the Republican Party.
p6140
aVI look forward to winning the nomination, and ultimately the presidency in order to Make America Great Again."
p6141
aVOn his appointment Mr. Manafort said, "I am honored to serve Mr. Trump's campaign, and look forward to helping secure his nomination as the Republican nominee for President.
p6142
aVMr. Trump has tapped into the growing disillusionment with the Washington political establishment.
p6143
aVWhat he has achieved so far is historic.
p6144
aVMy role is to work with the professionals that Mr. Trump has assembled to protect the victories that he has won in states across the country.
p6145
aVI am confident that he will be the Republican nominee and the next President of the United States."
p6146
aVIn addition, Mr. Trump is announcing that his campaign is opening a Washington, DC based office to coordinate his campaign's work with the Republican National Committee, Congress, and his convention and delegate operations.
p6147
aVThe office will serve as a conduit for outreach for Mr. Trump's campaign organization nationally.
p6148
aVJust released that international gangs are all over our cities.
p6149
aVThis will end when I am President!
p6150
aVWe need to secure our borders ASAP.
p6151
aVNo games, we must be smart, tough and vigilant.
p6152
aVMAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN & MAKE AMERICA STRONG AGAIN!
p6153
aVAllies must start paying for 'American protection!'

p6214
aVWe are going to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
p6215
aVA disgrace!
p6216
aVJust weeks before she stepped down as secretary of state, Hillary Clinton sent President Obama a memo urging him to close the Guantanamo Bay prison and offering strategies to do so.
p6217
aVAs a result, these terrorists are going back- to kill Americans!
p6218
aVHillary wrote to President Obama: "I remain a strong advocate of your policy to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility (GTMO) responsibly and to ensure U.S. detention policy and practice for terrorism suspects are consistent with U.S. values and do not strengthen our enemies."
p6219

aVLow energy Jeb Bush just endorsed a man he truly hates, Lyin' Ted Cruz.
p6240
aVHonestly, I can't blame Jeb in that I drove him into oblivion!
p6241
aVI think having Jeb's endorsement hurts Lyin' Ted.
p6242
aVJeb spent more than $150,000,000 and got nothing.
p6243
aVI spent a fraction of that and am first!
p6244
aVWe try so hard to be politically correct.
p6245
aVWe should try harder instead to solve the problem!
p6246
aVJust watched Hillary deliver a prepackaged speech on terror.
p6247
aVShe's been in office fighting terror for 20 years- and look where we are!
p6248
aVI will be the best by far in fighting terror.
p6249
aVI'm the only one that was right from the beginning, & now Lyin' Ted & others are copying me.
p6250
aVLyin' Ted Cruz steals foreign policy from me, and lines from Michael Douglas\u2014 just another dishonest politician.

p6253
aVI am honored to receive your support- TOGETHER, we will MAKE AMERICA SAFE & GREAT AGAIN!

p6269
aVWe do not give them the kind of respect they must have.
p6270
aVThe fact is- they do an incredible job!
p6271

p6709
aVI remain totally committed to eliminating rampant, widespread H-1B abuse and ending outrageous practices such as those that occurred at Disney in Florida when Americans were forced to train their foreign replacements.

aVDONALD J. TRUMP ANNOUNCES SENATOR SESSIONS AS CHAIRMAN OF NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISORY COMMITTEE  Senator Sessions to Provide Strategic Counsel to Mr. Trump on Foreign Policy and Homeland Security  (New York, NY) March 3rd, 2016 \u2013 Today Donald J. Trump announced Senator Jeff Sessions, who has advised the GOP frontrunner on issues such as trade and immigration and endorsed Mr. Trump on Sunday in Alabama, will serve as Chairman of Mr. Trump's National Security Advisory Committee.
p6752
aVSenator Sessions has been on the Armed Services Committee for almost 20 years and is Chairman of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee.
p6753
aVMr. Trump stated, "It is an honor to have Jeff as a member of the team.
p6754
aVI have such great respect for him and I look forward to working with him on the issues most important to Americans."
p6755
aVSenator Sessions added, "I am grateful for the opportunity to recommend and facilitate discussions among exceptional and experienced American military and diplomatic leaders to share insight and advice with Donald Trump, regardless of their political views.
p6756
aVMr. Trump and the American people know our country needs a clear-eyed foreign policy rooted in the national interest.
p6757
aVWe need to understand the limits of our ability to intervene successfully in other nations.
p6758
aVIt is time for a healthy dose of foreign policy realism.
p6759
aVIn the Middle East, this means forming partnerships based on shared interests, not merely overthrowing regimes in the dangerous attempt to plant democracies.
p6760
aVWe must also combat the refugee crisis by creating regional safe zones, rather than depopulating the region by migration.
p6761
aVThe only path to long-term stability and resolution of this humanitarian crisis for the United States and our European allies is to work towards the safe return of migrants to their home countries, as Mr. Trump has noted.
p6762
aVThis strategy will also protect our own national security."
p6763
aVSessions continued, "A national-interest foreign policy, combined with a military second to none, stands in contrast to interventionist ideas that could enmesh us further in the region's chaos.
p6764
aVAfter over a decade of war and conflict, this country has a host of smart, experienced, and proven leaders.
p6765
aVThat wisdom must be sought.
p6766
aVThese meetings will be the beginning of a process that Mr. Trump has called for and which he believes must result in a clear and realistic bipartisan global strategy that will guide our nation for years to come."
p6767
aVMr. Trump will continue to announce members of his National Security Advisory Committee and other advisors on key issues over the next few weeks.

aVSenator Sessions is widely recognized as the nation's most highly respected official on the issue of illegal immigration.
p6903
aVMr. Trump stated, "I am deeply honored to have the endorsement of Senator Jeff Sessions, leader of congressional conservatives.
p6904
aVHe has been called the Senate's indispensable man and the gold standard.
p6905
aVHe led the fight against the Gang of Eight, against Obama's trade deal, against Obama's judges, and for American sovereignty.
p6906

aVSenator Sessions added, "I am thrilled today to offer my endorsement of Donald J. Trump for President.
p6910
aVThis election is our last chance to save U.S. sovereignty and to end the domination of the political establishment over the interests of working Americans.
p6911
aVTrump alone has rejected the donor class, defending America's jobs and wages from open borders, uncontrolled immigration and the massive Trans-Pacific Partnership that will cede U.S. authority to foreign powers.
p6912
aVTrump's trade and immigration plans will revitalize our shrinking middle class, keeping jobs and wealth and income inside the United States of America.
p6913
aVTrump understands that a nation must always place the interests of its own people first."
p6914
aVSenator Sessions continued, "We are nearing fast the point of no return.

aVThe people are hurting.
p6916

p6921
aVMr. Trump is that leader.
p6922
aVWe are witnessing an incredible movement, arising from the people.
p6923
aVThe events of history have aligned to give the people this fleeting chance to bust up the oligarchy \u2013 to take back control from the 'Masters of the Universe' return it to the good and decent and patriotic citizens of the United States."
p6924

p7184
aV"What would happen to Vatican City if it was to do what Francis is asking America to do?"
p7185
aVIn response to the Pope:  If and when the Vatican is attacked by ISIS, which as everyone knows is ISIS's ultimate trophy, I can promise you that the Pope would have only wished and prayed that Donald Trump would have been President because this would not have happened.
p7186
aVISIS would have been eradicated unlike what is happening now with our all talk, no action politicians.
p7187
aVThe Mexican government and its leadership has made many disparaging remarks about me to the Pope, because they want to continue to rip off the United States, both on trade and at the border, and they understand I am totally wise to them.
p7188
aVThe Pope only heard one side of the story - he didn't see the crime, the drug trafficking and the negative economic impact the current policies have on the United States.
p7189
aVHe doesn't see how Mexican leadership is outsmarting President Obama and our leadership in every aspect of negotiation.
p7190
aVFor a religious leader to question a person's faith is disgraceful.
p7191
aVI am proud to be a Christian and as President I will not allow Christianity to be consistently attacked and weakened, unlike what is happening now, with our current President.
p7192
aVNo leader, especially a religious leader, should have the right to question another man's religion or faith.
p7193
aVThey are using the Pope as a pawn and they should be ashamed of themselves for doing so, especially when so many lives are involved and when illegal immigration is so rampant.
p7194
aVDonald J. Trump
p7195
aVI agree with Marco Rubio that Ted Cruz is a liar!

p7230
aVLet me be clear\u2014I am pro-life.
p7231
aVI support that position with exceptions allowed for rape, incest or the life of the mother being at risk.
p7232
aVI did not always hold this position, but I had a significant personal experience that brought the precious gift of life into perspective for me.
p7233
aVMy story is well documented, so I will not retell it here.
p7234
aVHowever, what I will do with the remaining space is express my feelings about life, and the culture of life, as we approach the 43nd anniversary of the Roe v. Wade.
p7235
aVI build things.
p7236
aVThere is a process involved in building things.
p7237
aVWe tap into a lot of disciplines with engineering being one of the most important.
p7238
aVThe rules for putting structures together are as strict as are the rules of physics.
p7239
aVThese rules have stood the test of time and have become the path to putting together structures that endure and are beautiful.
p7240
aVAmerica, when it is at its best, follows a set of rules that have worked since our founding.
p7241
aVOne of those rules is that we, as Americans, revere life and have done so since our Founders made it the first, and most important, of our "unalienable" rights.
p7242
aVOver time, our culture of life in this country has started sliding toward a culture of death.
p7243
aVPerhaps the most significant piece of evidence to support this assertion is that since Roe v. Wade was decided by the Supreme Count 43 years ago over 50 million Americans never had the chance to enjoy the opportunities offered by this country.
p7244
aVThey never had the chance to become doctors, musicians, farmers, teachers, husbands, fathers, sons or daughters.
p7245
aVThey never had the chance to enrich the culture of this nation or to bring their skills, lives, loves or passions into the fabric of country.
p7246
aVThey are missing, and they are missed.
p7247
aVThe Supreme Court in 1973 based their decision on imagining rights and liberties in the Constitution that are nowhere to be found.
p7248
aVEven if we take the court at its word, that abortion is a matter of privacy, we should then extend the argument to the logical conclusion that private funds, then, should subsidize this choice rather than the half billion dollars given to abortion providers every year by Congress.
p7249
aVPublic funding of abortion providers is an insult to people of conscience at the least and an affront to good governance at best.
p7250
aVIf using taxpayer money to facilitate our slide to a culture of death was not enough, the 1973 decision became a landmark decision demonstrating the utter contempt the court had for federalism and the 10th Amendment.
p7251
aVRoe v. Wade gave the court an excuse to dismantle the decisions of state legislatures and the votes of the people.
p7252
aVThis is a pattern that the court has repeated over and over again since that decision.
p7253
aVPerhaps Roe v. Wade became yet another incidence of disconnect between the people and their government.
p7254
aVWe are in the middle of a presidential political cycle and votes will be cast in just days.
p7255
aVThe citizens of this nation will have the chance to vote for candidates that are aligned with their individual worldviews.
p7256
aVIt is my hope that they will choose the builder, the man who has the ability to imagine the greatness of this nation.
p7257
aVThe next President must follow those principles that work best and that reinforce the reverence Americans hold for life.
p7258
aVA culture of life is too important to let slip away for convenience or political correctness.
p7259
aVIt is by preserving our culture of life that we will Make America Great Again.
p7260
aVWow!
p7261
aVA great new CNN poll just released.
p7262
aVTHANK YOU for your support, America!

aVTo get in contact with the campaign in SC go to https://www.donaldjtrump.com/south-carolina/volunteer/
p7284
aVRESPONSE TO THE LIES OF SENATOR CRUZ:   Ted Cruz is a totally unstable individual.
p7285
aVHe is the single biggest liar I've ever come across, in politics or otherwise, and I have seen some of the best of them.
p7286
aVHis statements are totally untrue and completely outrageous.
p7287
aVIt is hard to believe a person who proclaims to be a Christian could be so dishonest and lie so much.
p7288
aVCruz said I would be appointing a liberal judge when in fact I will appoint a great conservative and I am the only candidate who has gone so far, at the debate, as to suggest two individuals I feel would best represent the conservative values we need to protect: William "Bill" Pryor Jr. and Diane Sykes.
p7289
aVCruz says I am pro-choice, when in fact I am staunchly pro-life and have been for a long time.
p7290
aVLike Ronald Reagan, on many issues, I have evolved.
p7291
aVCruz says I am in favor of ObamaCare, when in fact I have spoken about repealing and replacing this disaster of a system at every speech throughout my campaign and since it's inception.
p7292
aVMeanwhile, Cruz was responsible for getting Bush to put in the judge that failed to vote against ObamaCare twice.
p7293
aVCruz says I will try to take away your second amendment rights, when I am one of the strongest proponents of the right to bear arms and I say so in every speech that I have made for years.
p7294
aVI am a proud member of the NRA and so are my sons.
p7295
aVCruz has become unhinged and is lying with the hopes that his statements will go unchecked until after the election and he will save his failing campaign.
p7296
aVIn Iowa, Cruz told thousands of Ben Carson voters that Dr. Carson had left the race and to instead vote for Ted Cruz.
p7297
aVHe apologized when the race was over.
p7298
aVLikewise, his fraudulent voter violation form sent to Iowa voters.
p7299
aVIf Ted is going to continue to lie with such desperation, I have no choice but to fight back.
p7300
aVOne of the ways I can fight back is to bring a lawsuit against him relative to the fact that he was born in Canada and therefore cannot be President.
p7301
aVIf he doesn't take down his false ads and retract his lies, I will do so immediately.
p7302
aVAdditionally, the RNC should intervene and if they don't they are in default of their pledge to me.
p7303
aVI am the strongest on the borders and I will build a wall, and it will be a real wall.
p7304
aVI am strongest on illegal immigration, strongest on ISIS, strongest on the military and I will take care of our Vets.
p7305
aVI will end common core and preserve the second amendment.
p7306
aVI will renegotiate our trade deals and bring our jobs back to our country.
p7307
aVI am the only person who will Make America Great Again.
p7308
aVNow that George Bush is campaigning for Jeb(!
p7309
aV), is he fair game for questions about World Trade Center, Iraq War and eco collapse?

aVTRUMP CAMPAIGN STATEMENT ON FOX NEWS DEBATE  (New York, NY) January 26th, 2016 - As someone who wrote one of the best-selling business books of all time, The Art of the Deal, who has built an incredible company, including some of the most valuable and iconic assets in the world, and as someone who has a personal net worth of many billions of dollars, Mr. Trump knows a bad deal when he sees one.
p7807
aVFOX News is making tens of millions of dollars on debates, and setting ratings records (the highest in history), where as in previous years they were low-rated afterthoughts.
p7808
aVUnlike the very stupid, highly incompetent people running our country into the ground, Mr. Trump knows when to walk away.
p7809
aVRoger Ailes and FOX News think they can toy with him, but Mr. Trump doesn't play games.
p7810
aVThere have already been six debates, and according to all online debate polls including Drudge, Slate, Time Magazine, and many others, Mr. Trump has won all of them, in particular the last one.
p7811
aVWhereas he has always been a job creator and not a debater, he nevertheless truly enjoys the debating process - and it has been very good for him, both in polls and popularity.
p7812
aVHe will not be participating in the FOX News debate and will instead host an event in Iowa to raise money for the Veterans and Wounded Warriors, who have been treated so horribly by our all talk, no action politicians.
p7813
aVLike running for office as an extremely successful person, this takes guts and it is the kind mentality our country needs in order to Make America Great Again.
p7814
aVThank you for the tremendous support, Marshalltown, Iowa!
p7815
aVI am also thankful for Sheriff Joe Arpaio's endorsement this evening!

p9184
aVHopefully in the future I will be proven wrong and she will be able to elevate her standards to a level of professionalism that a network such as FOX deserves.
p9185
aVMore importantly, I am very pleased to see the latest polls from Public Policy Polling showing me at a strong number one with 35% in New Hampshire, the Monmouth University poll showing me, again at number one, with 30% in South Carolina and the latest national poll from Gravis where I am again the clear front runner with 40%.

aVIt's about time!
p9293
aVDonald J. Trump Orders Flags to be flown at Half-Staff at all Trump Properties in Honor of the Five Fallen Soldiers  Mr. Trump Takes Action and Shows Commitment to Military and Vets  (New York, NY) July 20th, 2015- Today Donald J. Trump has ordered all flags at Trump properties around the country to be flown at half-staff in honor of the five fallen soldiers who were tragically killed in last week's shooting.
p9294
aVMr. Trump has long been a dedicated supporter of our military and our Veterans and if the President won't act, he will.
p9295
aVMr. Trump stated, "This disgraceful omission is unacceptable and yet another example of our incompetent politicians.
p9296
aVIt is a simple yet meaningful and important gesture that signifies our respect and recognition for these great soldiers who lost their lives.
p9297
aVWe must do better for all Americans, especially our military.
p9298
aVWe must Make America Great Again!"
p9299
aVIn addition to the lowering of the flags, Mr. Trump has established a hotline (855- VETS- 352) and email address (veterans@donaldtrump.com) for Veterans to share their stories about the need to reform our Veterans Administration.
p9300
aVIf he is elected President he will take care of these and all Veteran complaints very quickly and efficiently like a world-class business man can do, but a politician has no clue.
p9301
aVI am not at all surprised by the Des Moines Register's sophomoric editorial.
p9302
aVIt was issued immediately after the release of the ABC News/Washington Post poll showing me with 24% and an eleven-point lead over my nearest rival.
p9303
aVAs one of the most liberal newspapers in the United States, the poll results were just too much for them to bear.
p9304
aVThe Des Moines Register has lost much circulation, advertising, and power over the last number of years.
p9305
aVThey will do anything for a headline, and this poorly written "non-endorsement" got them some desperately needed ink.
p9306
aVOn the campaign trail in Iowa, a state whose people I have truly gotten to know and love, I have been treated very badly by the Des Moines Register.
p9307
aVThey were uneven and inconsistent, but far more importantly, very dishonest.
p9308
aVThey would rarely write the facts or report what really took place.
p9309
aVThey never captured the energy of each event and it is a constant battle with them by my representatives to get an accurate count of the large crowds I draw.
p9310
aVThey know the very impressive numbers and either reduce them or don't report them at all.
p9311
aVIt is always wonderful to have the support of a newspaper, even a failing one, but this has only given me more motivation to fight harder in Iowa and Make America Great Again!
p9312
aVWe will soon be at a point with our incompetent politicians where we will be treating illegal immigrants better than our veterans.
p9313
aVJohn McCain called thousands of people "crazies" when they came to seek help on illegal immigration last week in Phoenix.
p9314
aVHe owes apology!
p9315
aVIt's a national embarrassment that an illegal immigrant can walk across the border and receive free health care and one of our Veterans that has served our country is put on a waiting list and gets no care.
p9316
aVI am not a fan of John McCain because he has done so little for our Veterans and he should know better than anybody what the Veterans need, especially in regards to the VA.
p9317
aVHe is yet another all talk, no action politician who spends too much time on television and not enough time doing his job and helping the Vets.
p9318
aVHe is also allowing our military to decrease substantially in size and strength, something which should never be allowed to happen.
p9319
aVFurthermore, he was extremely disrespectful to the thousands upon thousands of people, many of whom happen to be his constituents, that came to listen to me speak about illegal immigration in Phoenix last week by calling them "crazies".
p9320
aVThese were not "crazies"---these were great American citizens.
p9321
aVI have great respect for all those who serve in our military including those that weren't captured and are also heroes.
p9322
aVI want to strengthen our military and take care of our Veterans.
p9323
aVI want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN especially for those that serve to protect our freedom.
p9324
aVI am fighting for our Veterans!
p9325
aVDonald J. Trump Response to Huffington Post   Mr. Trump is number one in the unimportant Huffington Post poll, along with all other recently released polls including Reuters, FOX, USA Today/Suffolk University and The Economist.
p9326
aVMr. Trump is in first place in Nevada, where he is also number one, by a wide margin, with Hispanics.
p9327
aVHe is number one in North Carolina and expects to win Iowa and New Hampshire.
p9328
aVMr. Trump singlehandedly raised the issue of illegal immigration and started a national conversation about what has turned out to be one of the most important topics of this election cycle.
p9329
aVLikewise, Mr. Trump is the leader on issues such as the terrible United States trade deals, strengthening our military, taking care of our great Vets and the repeal and replacement of Obamacare.
p9330
aVIf you read previously written Tweets, Mr. Trump has never been a fan of Arianna Huffington or the money-losing Huffington Post.
p9331
aVThe only clown show in this scenario is the Huffington Post pretending to be a legitimate news source.
p9332
aVMr. Trump is not focused on being covered by a glorified blog.
p9333
aVHe is focused on Making America Great Again.
p9334
aVGet rid of gun free zones.

p9341
aVFailing candidate Hillary Clinton, who is desperately trying to hold on to her lead in the democratic primary against Bernie Sanders, is knowingly putting out lies about my stance on illegal immigration.
p9342
aVI said "Mexico is sending"--- I'm not knocking immigration or immigrants, but rather am very critical of the country of Mexico for sending us people that they don't want.
p9343
aVLikewise I am very critical of illegal immigration and the tremendous problems including crime, which it causes.
p9344
aVShe is desperate, she is sad, and she is obviously very nervous when she has to revert to issues that have already been settled given the absolute accuracy of my statement.
p9345
aVShe speaks about "my tone" and that's the problem with our country's leaders.
p9346
aVThey are more worried about tone than results!
p9347
aVIt's not about being nice--- it's about being competent.
p9348
aVHillary should spend more time producing her illegally hidden emails and less time trying to obfuscate a statement by me that is totally clear and obviously very much accepted by the public as true.
p9349
aVI am honored, however, that she is attacking me, instead of Jeb Bush.
p9350
aVObviously she knows that JEB is no longer her real competition.
p9351
aVThe last person she wants to face is Donald Trump.
p9352
aVI am so happy that people are boycotting Macy's.

p9356

aVDONALD J. TRUMP WINS MAJOR VICTORY OVER N.Y STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIC SCHNEIDERMAN   (For Further Information Contact Michael Cohen 212.836.3212 Mcohen@trumporg.com or Jeff Goldman 212.867.4466 x312  jeffgoldman@bbwg.com)  The New York State Supreme Court has just issued various rulings which destroy the case brought by New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman against Donald J. Trump's Trump University.
p9744
aVThe three most important causes of actions have been thrown out entirely and the $40M damage claim is now down to a very small amount of money, if any.
p9745
aVThe minor remaining portions of the case create a very heavy burden for the Attorney General to win, as his case is based on "inadmissible, unsigned evidence," according to the Court ruling.
p9746
aVSchneiderman also lost his motion for summary judgment because there was no proof of any fraud whatsoever.
p9747
aVIndeed, the Court called out Schneiderman's "evidentiary deficiencies."
p9748
aVMr. Trump stated "Eric Schneiderman is a total lightweight who is considered by many, including myself, to be the worst Attorney General in the United States.
p9749
aVHe spent millions of dollars of taxpayers' money trying to build his name and reputation on publicity by going after me and now his entire case has been totally decimated.
p9750
aVThis all for a school that has a 98% approval rating from its students.
